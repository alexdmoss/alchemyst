<p class="c4"><span class="c1">When a magnetic nucleus is placed in a magnetic field, it adopts one of a small
                number of allowed orientations of different energy. For example, the nucleus of the hydrogen atom has
                just
                two permitted orientations. The magnetic moment can point in the same direction as the field, or in the
                opposite direction. These two states are separated by an energy </span><span
                class="c9 c1">&Delta;</span><span class="c1">E, which depends on the strength of the interaction between
                the
                nucleus and the field, i.e. on the size of the nuclear magnetic moment and the strength of the magnetic
                field. </span><span class="c9 c1">&Delta;</span><span class="c1">E can me measured by applying
                electromagnetic radiation of frequency v, which causes nuclei to flip from the lower energy level to the
                upper one, provided the resonance condition </span><span class="c9 c1">&Delta;</span><span
                class="c3 c1">E =
                hv is satisfied. This is nuclear magnetic resonance.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">For a given field strength, the energy gap </span><span class="c9 c1">&Delta;</span><span
                class="c3 c1">E and therefore the resonance frequency, are determined
                principally by the nuclide observed, because every nuclide has a characteristic magnetic moment. But
                there
                is more to it than this. This is because the resonance frequency also depends slightly on the chemical
                environment of the nucleus in a molecule, an effect known as the chemical shift.</span></p>

<p class="c4"><span class="c7 c1">Spin Angular Momentum &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">Magnetic nuclei possess an intrinsic angular momentum known as spin, whose magnitude
                is quantised in units of </span><span class="c10">h</span><span class="c1">/</span><span
                class="c8">2</span><span class="c9 c8">&pi;</span><span class="c3 c1">.</span></p>

<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">The spin quantum number I of a nucleus may have one of the following
                values,</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c3 c1">I = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, &hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">With quantum numbers greater than 4 being rare. This number is determined largely by
                the number of unpaired protons and neutrons. For example, an isotope such as </span><span
                class="c10">12</span><span class="c1">C has even numbers of protons and neutrons &ndash; all the protons
                pair up with antiparallel spins, as do all the neutrons, giving a net spin angular momentum of zero. A
                nucleus with odd numbers of protons and neutrons generally has an integral, non-zero quantum number
                because
                the total number of unpaired nucleons is even, and each of the contributes a half to the quantum number.
                However, it is difficult to predict exactly how many protons and neutrons will be unpaired except in
                cases
                such as </span><span class="c10">2</span><span class="c3 c1">H.</span></p>

                nucleus

<p class="c4"><span class="c7 c1">Nuclear Magnetisation &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">The magnetic moment of a nucleus is intimately connected with its spin angular

<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">In the presence of a strong field, the quantisation axis z is no longer arbitrary,

                class="c3 c1">B</span></p>

        </span><span class="c3 c1">B</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">That is, the energy of the nucleus is shifted by an amount proportional to the

                and
                it becomes clear that NMR signals must be rather weak. It is therefore of crucial importance to optimise

<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">The chemical shift is not the only source of information encoded in an NMR

                with their surroundings. Not all nuclei will give sharp lines however. This is typically the case for

                circulate </span><span class="c1">in the xy plane. This induced current generates a magnetic field which
                (it

                deshields a
                nucleus at the centre of the electron density.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">The extent of deshielding is clearly linked to the energy gaps involved &ndash; other
                things being equal, low-lying excited states should make a greater contribution than higher energy

<p class="c4"><span class="c0">Contributions to Nuclear Shielding</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">Almost impossible to be able to calculate chemical shifts from first principles, as
                need a large amount of information on all the wavefunctions. Simplest to consider the contributions to

</ol>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">The first two are contributions from electrons in the immediate vicinity of the
                nucleus. The third accounts for electrons circulating around other nearby nuclei. The final part
                includes
                electric field shifts, H-bonding, solvent shifts, unpaired electrons, etc.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c7 c1">Local Diamagnetic Shifts &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">Strongly dependent on </span><span class="c1 c6">electron density </span><span

                the chemical shift. This is aptly shown by methyl halides, where increasing electronegativity of the
                halogen
                leads to electron-withdrawal from the methyl group, deshielding the protons. This effect is relatively
                short

<p class="c4"><span class="c1">In aromatic compounds, the extensive </span><span class="c9 c1">&pi;</span><span
                class="c3 c1">-electron clouds supports large electronic currents. The dominant contribution to the
                magnetic
                anisotropy comes from the circulation of these electrons within their delocalised molecular orbitals,
                i.e.
                the neighbouring group effect is due principally to the diamagnetic moment induced when the external
                field
                is perpendicular to the molecular plane (right).</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">However, the end result is the same as acetylene because the induced diamagnetic
                moment is opposed to the external field so that the anisotropy is negative. Thus, we can anticipate
                deshielding for nuclei in the plane of the aromatic ring, and shielding for any nuclei above or below
                the
                ring.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">This ring current shift is demonstrated clearly by benzene itself, whose </span><span
                class="c10">1</span><span class="c1">H shift is 1.4ppm to the high frequency side of the olefinic
                protons in
                cyclohexa-1,3-diene. A more interesting example is the dimethyl substituted pyrene, which with
                14</span><span class="c9 c1">&pi;</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;electrons, is aromatic according to
                the
                4n+2 rule. The ring protons are deshielded, as expected, but the methyl groups, which protrude above and
                below the plane of the molecule, are shielded by more than 5ppm relative to ethane. These protons lie in
                a
                region where the induced field opposes the external field.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">Similarly, planar annulene with 4n+2 = 18 shows two proton resonances, one from the
                12 strongly deshielded external protons, and one at -3ppm from the 6 internal protons. The latter set of
                Hs
                lie within the current loop formed by the circulating </span><span class="c9 c1">&pi;</span><span
                class="c3 c1">-electrons, and are shielded by the ring current. </span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">The magnitude of the neighbouring group effect depends on the magnetic anisotropy
                of the group itself and not on the nucleus. Hence this is relatively more important for protons (due to
                their small local diamagnetic and paramagnetic shielding effects).</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c7 c1">Other sources of chemical shifts &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">Hydrogen bonding is responsible for some of the largest observed deshielding effects
                in </span><span class="c10">1</span><span class="c3 c1">H NMR. The hydrogen-bonded proton is heavily
                deshielded. This effect is stronger for intramolecular H-bonds (as they are usually stronger).</span>
</p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Chemical shifts are also affected by the local electric fields arising from
                charged or polar groups. These can modify diamagnetic and paramagnetic currents by polarising local
                electron
                distributions, and by perturbing ground and excited state wavefunctions and energies. Positive charges
                usually deshield nearby protons, while negative charges often cause shielding.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">There are also paramagnetic shifts produced by unpaired electrons (referring to
                the magnetic moment of the electron and not to the induced electronic currents discussed above).
                Unpaired
                electrons give rise to large dipolar magnetic fields &ndash; the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron is
                660
                times that of the proton.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0">Spin-Spin Coupling</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Magnetic interaction between nuclei can also be used to elucidate structure. This
                nuclear spin-spin coupling causes NMR lines to split into a small number of components with
                characteristic
                relative intensities and spacings.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">For example, in H</span><span class="c10">13</span><span class="c1">CO</span><span
                class="c8">2</span><span class="c10">-</span><span class="c1">, we see two lines (a doublet) in each of
                the
        </span><span class="c10">1</span><span class="c1">H and </span><span class="c10">13</span><span class="c1">C NMR
                spectra. The splitting gives the strength of </span><span class="c10">1</span><span
                class="c1">H-</span><span class="c10">13</span><span class="c3 c1">C spin-spin interaction and is the
                same
                in the two spectra.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">The </span><span class="c10">1</span><span class="c1">H resonance is split into two
                because the magnetic moment of the </span><span class="c10">13</span><span class="c1">C nucleus is the
                source of a small local magnetic field whose direction is determined by the </span><span
                class="c10">13</span><span class="c1">C magnetic quantum number. When the </span><span
                class="c10">13</span><span class="c1">C is its in m=+&frac12; state, its magnetic field at the position
                of
                the </span><span class="c10">1</span><span class="c1">H opposes the external field and shifts the
        </span><span class="c10">1</span><span class="c3 c1">H resonance to lower frequency. Conversely, for m=-&frac12;
                carbon, the local field adds to the external field at the proton and moves its resonance to a higher
                frequency. Hence, two lines are seen. </span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">Since the difference in energy between the two configurations of the carbon nucleus
                is tiny compared to the thermal energy, the two values are equally likely and the two components of the
        </span><span class="c10">1</span><span class="c1">H doublet are equally intense. An exactly analogous argument
                explains the splitting of the </span><span class="c10">13</span><span class="c1">C resonance by the
        </span><span class="c10">1</span><span class="c3 c1">H. It should be noted that homonuclear couplings, e.g.
                between protons with different chemical shifts, give rise to splittings in exactly the same way.</span>
</p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">The properties of spin-spin coupling may be summarised and generalised in the
                following simple expression for the energy of two interacting nuclei A and X (not necessarily

                J</span><span class="c8">AX</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;is the spin-spin coupling constant. The
                latter
                is measured in Hz and may be positive or negative &ndash; if the antiparallel arrangement of nuclear
                spins
                is energetically favoured then it is positive, while if parallel spin is lower in energy it is negative
                (although this will have no effect on the appearance of the spectrum).</span></p>

<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">If the nucleus of interest, A, has spin quantum number greater than &frac12;, the
                multiplet structure can be predicted in exactly the same way as for spin-1/2 nucleus. For example,

                1:4:6:4:1. The NH coupling constants of the two isotopomers are in the ratio 0.73:1, which is the ratio
                of
                gyromagnetic ratios of the two nitrogen isotopes.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">However, nuclei with I&gt;&frac12; possess, in addition to their magnetic dipole
                moment, an electric quadrupole moment that can interact with local electric field gradients. For
                molecules
                tumbling in solution, this interaction can lead to efficient relaxation of the quadrupolar nucleus and
                NMR
                lines that are so broad that the expected multiplet patterns are partially or completely
                obscured.</span>
</p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">For A (I=&frac12;) coupled to X (I&gt;&frac12;) the principles above can easily be
                extended. The magnetic moment of a spin-I particle has 2I+1 orientations with respect to the magnetic
                field
                B</span><span class="c8">0</span><span class="c1">. Therefore a nucleus coupled to a single X spin with
                quantum number I should show a multiplet comprising 2I+1 lines with equal spacings and amplitudes. For
                example, the </span><span class="c10">13</span><span class="c1">C spectrum of deuterated chloroform,
        </span><span class="c10">13</span><span class="c1">CDCl</span><span class="c8">3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is
                a 1:1:1 triplet arising from the three equally probable states of the deuteron, m = +1,0,-1. Once again,
                quadrupolar relaxation may upset these predictions. Rapid relaxation of the quadrupolar nucleus may have
                the
                effect of decoupling A and X, such that no splitting is observed in the spectrum of A. For example,
        </span><span class="c10">35</span><span class="c1">Cl and </span><span class="c10">37</span><span class="c1">l

                class="c3 c1">) rarely produce splittings in the NMR spectra of nearby nuclei.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">For coupling to equivalent I &gt; &frac12; nuclei, the multiplet patterns are easily
                deduced using the tree diagram approach. For instance, the terminal protons of </span><span

                seven
                line pattern with relative intensities 1:2:3:4:3:2:1, arising from equal interactions with the two

<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">More generally, a set of nuclei with identical chemical shifts (call them

<p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;As might be expected, the NMR spectra of molecules containing chemically

<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">The </span><span class="c10">1</span><span class="c1">H spectrum of CH</span><span
                class="c8">2</span><span class="c1">F</span><span class="c8">2</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;comprises
                just three lines, a 1:2:1 triplet with splitting equal to the proton-fluorine coupling constant. The
                remarkable thing about this spectrum is not the triplet, but the absence of any splittings arising from
                the
                proton-proton coupling. Although the two protons interact with one another, this coupling does not
                manifest
                itself as a splitting in the spectrum. In fact this is a general feature of scalar coupling &ndash;
                spin-spin interactions within a group of magnetically equivalent nuclei do not produce multiplet
                splittings.
                This is actually because of the changes in transition probabilities and NMR frequencies arising from the
                mixing of spin states by the spin-spin interaction.</span></p>

<p class="c4"><span class="c1">This is for a pair of spin-&frac12; nuclei. As the difference in resonance
                frequencies is reduced, keeping J fixed, the inner component of each doublet steadily increases in
                amplitude, while the outer components become weaker. The two doublets move together as their chemical
                shift
                difference vanishes, until at </span><span class="c9 c1">&delta;&nu; </span><span class="c3 c1">= 0 the
                inner lines coincide and the outer lines vanish.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">This occurs because the effect of the scalar coupling is to mix the spin states, so
                modifying their wavefunctions and energies. The result is a change in the transition probabilities of
                the
                four NMR lines, the inner lines becoming more allowed (i.e. stronger) and the outer pair less so
                (weaker).
                The effect is more pronounced the smaller the gap </span><span class="c9 c1">&delta;&nu; </span><span
                class="c1">is between the nearly equivalent nuclear spin wavefunctions relative to J</span><span

<p class="c4"><span class="c1">This gets consider more complicated for three or more nuclei, and masks the
                information likely to be extracted. Fortunately the problem of strong coupling is diminished easily,
                because
                coupling constants are independent of the static magnetic field while </span><span
                class="c9 c1">&delta;&nu;
        </span><span class="c3 c1">is not. Thus a strongly coupled spin system can often be made weakly coupled by using

<p class="c4"><span class="c7 c1">Properties of Scalar Coupling</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">The strength of the interaction is crucially dependent on the s-electron character
                of the ground state and electronically excited state wavefunctions at the positions of the nuclei. The
                coupling is not affected by the strength or the direction of the external magnetic field, in contrast to
                the
                differences in resonance frequencies that arise from nuclear shielding. Indirect spin-spin couplings are
                therefore independent of the spectrometer frequency, and being isotropic are not affected by molecular

                class="c3 c1">. A
                process described as slow or fast on the NMR timescale is slow or fast compared to the difference in
                resonance frequencies of the exchanging nuclei. Since this is rarely larger than a few kHz, and often
                much
                smaller, only relatively slow equilibria (seconds to microseconds) can be studied by NMR.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0">Spin Relaxation</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">There are two types &ndash; spin-lattice relaxation and spin-spin relaxation.
                These allow nuclear spins to return to equilibrium following some disturbance.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c7 c1">Spin-Lattice Relaxation &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Before starting the NMR experiment, the 2I+1 energy levels of a spin-I nucleus are
                degenerate (neglecting the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field) and their populations are equal. When the
                sample is
                dropped into the magnetic field, the spin states suddenly split apart in energy. The populations,
                however,
                cannot adjust themselves instantaneously and remain equal. If this non-equilibrium state were to
                persist,
                NMR spectroscopy would be impossible. Spin-lattice relaxation enables the &nbsp;spins to flip amongst
                their
                energy levels so as to establish the Boltzmann population differences required for a successful NMR
                experiment. As the nuclei approach equilibrium, the energy released is dissipated in the surroundings
                (the
                lattice).</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">These changes in populations are characterised by a time T</span><span

                of
                spin-1/2 nuclei, assuming exponential relaxation (which is often the case), the difference in the number
                of

<p class="c4"><span class="c7 c1">Origin of Spin-Lattice Relaxation &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Relaxation mechanisms that operate in other forms of spectroscopy are ineffective
                for NMR. Spontaneous emission (fluorescence), whose rate depends on the frequency of the transition
                cubed,
                is exceedingly slow at NMR frequencies. Deactivation of excited states by molecular collisions is also
                negligible because nuclear spins interact so weakly with the rest of the world that they are effectively
                decoupled from the motions of the molecules that contain them. As a molecule rotates, its nuclear spins
                remain aligned with the magnetic field, rather than reorientating with the molecule.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">The mechanism of nuclear spin relaxation lies in magnetic interactions, the most
                important being dipolar coupling. The dipolar coupling between two nuclei depends on their separation r,
                and
                on </span><span class="c9 c1">&theta;</span><span class="c1">, the angle between the internuclear vector
                and
                the static field. Although this purely anisotropic coupling leads to no splittings in the NMR spectra of
                molecules in liquids, the instantaneous interaction is far from negligible. As the molecules translate,
                rotate and vibrate in solution, r and </span><span class="c9 c1">&theta;</span><span
                class="c3 c1">&nbsp;vary in a complicated way causing the interaction to fluctuate rapidly. Thus the
                dipolar
                coupling, modulated by molecular motions, which, if they contain a component at the NMR frequency, can
                induce the radiationless transitions which return the spins to equilibrium. Most other relaxation
                mechanisms
                have essentially the same origin &ndash; and intra- or intermolecular magnetic (or for I&gt;&frac12;
                nuclei,
                electronic) interaction, rendered time-dependent by random molecular motion.</span></p>

                referred to as tumbling. After waiting a long time, a molecule&rsquo;s orientations will be randomly

                all
                possible orientations of the molecules in the disordered solid, the result is a single, largely
                featureless
                peak with a width related to the root-mean-square dipolar interaction, which might be several
                kilohertz.</span></p>

<p class="c4"><span class="c7 c1">Quadrupolar Relaxation</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">A nucleus with a spin quantum number greater than &frac12; possess an electric
                quadrupole moment in addition to its magnetic dipole moment. One can think of this in terms of an
                ellipsoidal charge distribution in the nucleus with an excess of positive charge near the north and
                south
                poles and a corresponding depletion around the equator. Unlike electric dipoles &ndash; for example
                polar
                molecules HCl &ndash; electric quadrupoles do not interact with spatially uniform electric fields, but
                only
                with electric field gradients, a property that may be understood by regarding the nuclear quadrupole
                moment
                as two identical back-to-back electric dipoles.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c11"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">The electric field gradient at a nucleus is a measure of the non-uniform
                distribution of local electronic charge: in sufficiently high symmetry environments &ndash; spherical,
                cubic, octahedral or tetrahedral &ndash; the electric field gradients generated by surrounding charges
                exactly cancel out, giving no net quadrupolar interaction. Nuclei in lower symmetry environments,
                however,
                experience non-zero electric field gradients which depend on the orientation of the molecule in the
                magnetic
                field of the NMR spectrometer. For example, two negative charges at a fixed distance from a quadrupolar
                nucleus have a more favourable Coulombic interaction when they are on the spin axis, i.e. close to the
                poles
                of the non-spherical nucleus, than on when they are in the equatorial plane. This anisotropic
                interaction,
                like the magnetic dipolar coupling, produces splittings in the NMR spectra of single crystals, and gives
                broad lines for powders and disordered solids. Quadrupolar interactions also cause spin relaxation when
                modulated by molecular tumbling.</span></p>
