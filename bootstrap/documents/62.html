                these,
                the Ti occupies octahedral holes. </span></p>

                class="c5">4</span><span class="c0">. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Ti metal can be obtained from TiCl</span><span class="c5">4</span><span
                class="c3">&nbsp;by adding Mg with a lack of air (both N</span><span class="c5">2</span><span

                reduction).</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Radius = 147pm. Silver metal with high melting point, indicative of some metal-metal
                bonding (1667</span><span class="c2">o</span><span class="c0">C).</span></p>

                class="c2">2</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reacts with non-metals after heating.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Ti(II) is a strong reducing agent, and the low ionisation energy here typifies this.
                As anticipated, the M/H</span><span class="c5">2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;couple will get more and
                more
                oxidising across the period, as the ionisation energy increases.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Compounds &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oxidation State of +4 is the most pronounced, which indicates covalent character (a
                +4 ion would be unstable). It can have lower oxidation states though, but these are readily
                oxidised.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ti has a high affinity for Oxygen (sulphide ores are rare, unlike other
                TM&rsquo;s).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Ti-O bonds are short and strong, which implies d(</span><span
                class="c10 c3">&pi;</span><span class="c3">)-p(</span><span class="c10 c3">&pi;</span><span class="c0">)
                bonding (vacant d orbitals on Ti). As a result, the metal often has an oxide film (so resists
                corrosion).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">TiO</span><span class="c5">2</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is a white pigment and
                fairly unreactive. It occupies the rutile structure predominantly (distorted HCP with half Octahedral
                holes
                occupied by Ti). However, other oxides can be formed, e.g. Ti</span><span class="c5">2</span><span
                class="c3">O</span><span class="c5">3</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and TiO.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">TiCl</span><span class="c5">4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;forms adducts with ethers,
                esters, ketones, etc.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All tetrahalides are known. As the halide changes the colour changes, i.e. the
                charge-transfer band is moved to steadily lower energies (more absorption in the visible region).
        </span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Note that the tetrahalide is most stable (as in the extraction process). There is now
                highly covalent bonding.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All trihalides are known. Hard to make since tetrahalides so stable, which are
                difficult to reduce.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Also, TiX</span><span class="c5">2</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;can be formed by
                reduction of TiX</span><span class="c5">4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with Ti. There is extensive
                Metal-Metal bonding here (as shown by a low magnetic dipole moment). These are strongly reducing.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Compounds with oxoanions are not really favoured, due to high ratio of ionic charge
                to radius of Ti(IV).</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Metal-Metal Bonding will occur. It is favoured due to large d-orbital overlap (it is
                relative to other TM&rsquo;s a large metal ion). There is only 1 d electron present in Ti</span><span
                class="c2">3+</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;though. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Due to the small M-M distance, anions must be small to interact, therefore ions of O,
                X. The consequence of this is higher enthalpies (e.g. of atomization).</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Titanium is just about large enough to reach coordinate 8 ligands, but this is
                rare.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Octahedral is the most common arrangement with halides and water, while tetrahedral
                is adopted by halides. Basically there is a wide range of stereochemistry due to the d</span><span

                due to few d electrons to strengthen it.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ti often electron deficient. This is because 6 ligands is still not enough to attain
                18e. This is important in polymerisation catalysis (C=C electron rich). Ziegler-Natta catalysts &ndash;

<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Extraction &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Difficult to extract due to affinity for oxygen. Use the iodide decomposition process
                and then reduction with sodium. The two elements are separated by the sodium, i.e. an ion exchange resin
                &ndash; otherwise difficult.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Structure &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These elements have virtually identical radii. Only things that differ are densities,
                transition temperatures and neutron-absorbing abilities.</span></p>

                bonding is observed down the Group due to the increase in size (overlap) such that transition
                temperatures
                and enthalpies of atomisation increase.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their size also explains why they occur as more basic oxides (more aqueous
                chemistry).</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Trends in Oxidation States &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">More stable in higher states. Lower states tend to be reducing, and are not stable in
                water (no aquocation complexes).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">+4 tends to dominate.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Structure of Oxides &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Only stable oxides are MO</span><span class="c5">2</span><span class="c0">. These are
                7-coordinate.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Structure of Halides &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zr &amp; Hf halides are all white (they are less polarizing to the halide compared to
                Ti).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are typically tetrahedral, although this can vary in the solid state, where
                octahedral coordination can occur to give zigzag polymer chains which edge-share.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">All tetrahalides are known, and also all trihalides except HfF</span><span
                class="c5">3</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any lower halides will form clusters.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Complexing &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will favour much higher coordination numbers such as 7 &amp; 8, e.g. ZrF</span><span
                class="c5">8</span><span class="c2">4-</span><span class="c3">, ZrF</span><span class="c5">7</span><span
                class="c2">3-</span><span class="c0">, etc. Zr tends to favour 8. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There size allows them to coordinate more ligands without steric repulsions, and this
                is advantageous electrostatically. Lower oxidation states are usually hydrolysed, as these element
                favour
                O-donor ligands strongly like Titanium.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Uses &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zr is a useful structural metal (like Ti). Low neutron capture cross-section, use for
                nuclear fuel cans. Must separate Hf fully for this.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">ZrO</span><span class="c5">2</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is as hard as diamond
                &ndash; used as a cutting tool. Reacts with steam to form H</span><span class="c5">2</span><span

<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Properties &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Radius has contracted compared to Ti, showing that the extra d electron does not
                compensate sufficiently for the extra nuclear charge (higher Z</span><span class="c5">eff</span><span

<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Highest melting point of the 1</span><span class="c2">st</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;row
                (1915</span><span class="c2">o</span><span class="c0">C) since Vanadium is the last
                element before some of the (n-1)d electrons begin to enter the inert electron core of the atom (hence
                not
                available for bonding).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the same reason, it is also last element that is not strongly oxidising in the
                Group oxidation state.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Trends in Oxidation States &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">+4 state is most stable, but +3 and +2 are stable (although reducing).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vanadium is the most stable Transition Metal in lower oxidation states.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only pentahalide is with fluoride (since it is so oxidising), otherwise Vanadium(V)
                forms pentoxides and oxohalides.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">VO</span><span class="c2">2+</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a very stable ion
                (vanadyl).</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Coordination Numbers &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">+4 state can reach 8 (which would be good with low steric repulsions, because M-L
                bonds maximise the energy of the complex), but not +5 unless bidentate ligands, because the metal is too
                small, and steric effects become limiting.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Tends to form octahedral complexes (typical of 1</span><span class="c2">st</span><span

                class="c5">5</span><span class="c0">. Complicated arrangement of trigonal bipyramids.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c3">In alkali it forms VO</span><span class="c5">4</span><span class="c2">3-</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Intermediate pHs give hydrolysis / polymerisation reactions to form
                isopolyvanadates.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">This oxide can also be reduced to VO</span><span class="c5">2</span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;(deep blue, rutile distorted by M-M bonding).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Magneli phases (see later metals) can be formed by reduction with H</span><span
                class="c5">2</span><span class="c0">, CO or C.</span></p>

                class="c0">&nbsp;is highly basic (V(III) ions formed) and is conductive above 170K
                but insulating below this.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">VO can also be formed (grey).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, wide range of oxides possible.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Structure of Halides &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vanadium V forms only the fluoride. This forms a polymer chain.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vanadium IV does not form the iodide.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All halides of V(III) and V(II) are known.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Hydrolysis of VCl</span><span class="c5">4</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;gives
                oxovanadium(IV) chloride (similarly for VBr</span><span class="c5">4</span><span class="c0">).</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dihalides have simplistic structure.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">In Aqueous &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">VO</span><span class="c5">5</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;gives polymerised
                vanadates.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Complexing &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vanadium(V) binds to oxygen very strongly, like titanium. Means that complexes not
                containing V-O bonds are susceptible to hydrolysis.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tetrahalides of oxidation state +4 are Lewis acids, and end up coordinating 6.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">VO</span><span class="c5">2</span><span class="c2">+</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;stable,
                vanadium(IV). Is </span><span class="c3 c17">type a </span><span class="c0">(hard),
                binds very strongly to F in particular. Usually 5-coordinate square pyramidal.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vanadium(III) is similar to Titanium(III) and favours octahedral coordination
                (d</span><span class="c2">2</span><span class="c0">).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">M-C sigma bond is very weak &ndash; limited chemistry, but more stable than Titanium
                version. Will form a hexacarbonyl, for example.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mostly octahedral and tetrahedral compounds (since low spin always, no reason for
                Square Planar).</span></p>

<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Extraction &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dissolve in acid, then separate by solvent extraction (one more soluble than the
                other), then reduce with Na or C.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Structure &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Metallic BCC. Shiny silver metals. Nb used with Zr in superconductors.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ta very resistant to corrosion &ndash; tough oxide layer. Also is an
                insulator.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Properties &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike V, the entry of (n-1)d electrons does not occur, and they are not of the
                highest melting points. However, they are higher than V, indicating more metal-metal bonding is
                occurring.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tend to oxidise, as for Vanadium.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two elements are virtually identical in size (due to Lanthanide Contraction
                &ndash; addition f-electron shell is weakly shielding and allows d-electrons to penetrate just as well
                for
                Ta as for Nb).</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Trends in Oxidation States &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mostly +5. Note that highest oxidation state of V is the most favoured of the triad
                below. Other oxidation states rarely found. This is because the 4d and 5d orbitals are less influenced
                by
                the formal charge of the metal as they penetrate further into the core.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Coordination Numbers &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">+5 state gives coordination number of 8 even with monodentate ligands. This is due to
                these elements being larger than V, so they can coordinate more ligands without the interference of
                steric
                repulsion between them.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">+3/+2 chemistry not known. Instead, form cluster compounds based on octahedral
                M</span><span class="c5">6</span><span class="c3">X</span><span class="c5">12</span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;units. This indicates strong metal-metal bonding due to greater overlap of orbitals (as
                shown by high enthalpies of atomisation).</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Structure of Oxides &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pentoxides are much more stable for Nb and Ta than for V, so hard to reduce. Hence
                there is less of a range of oxides found. Nb more easily forms lower oxides than Ta.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">More extensive metal-metal bonding is observed here due to greater overlap.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Structure of Halides &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All halides known for Nb and Ta in the high oxidation state (unique in this
                respect).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">MF</span><span class="c5">3</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and TaF</span><span
                class="c5">4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;not known. Clustering occurs in lower oxidation states.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">MF</span><span class="c5">5</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;are tetramers,
                MCl</span><span class="c5">5</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and MBr</span><span class="c5">5</span><span
                class="c3">&nbsp;are dimers (contrast VF</span><span class="c5">5</span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;polymers).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tetrahalides are easily hydrolysed.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Structures reflect increased metal-metal bonding tendencies.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dihalides do not exist. Instead forms clusters. These are diamagnetic, indicating
                metal-metal bonding.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Complexing &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nb(V) and Ta(V) are often pentahalides. Concentrations of HF can be varied to
                increase coordination to 6, 7 and 8 (more easily for Ta).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In aqueous solutions, X=Cl, Br will give oxochloro- or oxobromo- complexes
                instead.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Forms octahedral and tetrahedral complexes on the whole. Can coordinate more ligands
                than V though, due to size (sterics).</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Ionisation Energy has also increased, and successive ionisation energies are

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">+5 is unstable.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">+3 is the dominant oxidation state (d=3). It forms very stable complexes, which do
                not substitute ligands easily. Drop from +4 being most stable in Vanadium because of more electrons in

                core.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">+2 is Jahn-Teller distorted. It is strongly reducing. The ethanoate can be isolated
                and dimerises, indicating metal-metal bonding occurs. This compound is also diamagnetic.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cr(0) is stable, e.g. Cr(CO)</span><span class="c5">6</span><span class="c0">. This
                fulfils the 18e rule. There is a wide range of low oxidation state organometallic compounds.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c3">CrO</span><span class="c5">3</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;has low melting point,

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hexahalides easily hydrolysed.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Dihalides are Jahn-Teller distorted (d</span><span class="c2">4</span><span

<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Complexing &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oxidation State VI tends to involve oxohalides not halides.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oxidation State V not stable, hydrolyse with disproportionation to Cr(III) and

<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Oxidation State III easily the most common, and almost always octahedral

                Jahn-Teller also occurs. Tends to form dinuclear compounds with multiple metal-metal bonds + bridging

<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Organometallics &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">6 ligands will satisfy the 18e rule, so there is plenty of scope for organometallic

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Metallic BCC, silver, fairly soft.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Metal-Metal bonding is more prolific in these elements because the d-orbital overlap
                is larger and the electron-electron repulsions are smaller. In fact, Tungsten is the last element in the

                (i.e.
                it forms metal-metal bonds to the greatest degree of all TM&rsquo;s).</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">The M-M bonds do not occur in higher oxidation states (e.g. not in Mo</span><span

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hexahalides easily hydrolysed.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Structure of Mo &amp; W trihalides often distorts to increase metal-metal

<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Complexing &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oxidation State V is more stable for these metals than Cr.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oxidation State III few and far between, especially for W (metal-metal triple bonds

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oxidation State II shows a difference between Mo and W, Mo behaves like Cr in that it
                tends to form dinuclear metal-metal bonded compounds, while W does not.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Organometallics &ndash;</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for Cr, 18e rule easily satisfied, so many organometallic compounds

<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Structure &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">4 allotropes known, most common in BCC. Hard and brittle.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Metal-metal bonding is weak because 3d electrons are held tightly in inert electron
                core. Hence lower mp (1244</span><span class="c2">o</span><span class="c0">C) and enthalpy of
                atomisation.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Change in the common trend for radii, where Mn is large compared to the expected drop
                across the period. This is due to the stability of the free d</span><span class="c2">5</span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;configuration, and also explains the further loss of metal-metal bonding that is
                seen.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Trends in Oxidation States &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Most stable is +2 (high spin d</span><span class="c2">5</span><span class="c3">) and
                follows the trend V</span><span class="c0">&#129130;Cr&#129130;Mn). This great stability explains why
                the
                redox potential in moving from higher oxidation states is so large.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">+7 is Group Oxidation state, and is extremely oxidising (3d electrons held tightly by
                nucleus).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wide range of states possible because the d-orbitals have not yet dropped in energy
                into the inert electron core, so the number of electrons available for bonding is maximised.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Redox &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Highly electropositive compared to its neighbours in Periodic Table. More

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fe has extensive aqueous chemistry in lower oxidation states.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oxidation State III complexes can be either high or low spin, and are usually (but
                not always) octahedral. The aquo ion is too easily hydrolysed to be common. Iron in this state greatly
                prefers O-donors to N-donors (ammines very unstable, even chelating ones are) (unlike Cr(III) which is

<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Fe(III) is d</span><span class="c2">5</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and thus there is

                unless ligand is very strong.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oxidation State II will bind to almost any anion. Aquated ion is stable now. Fe(II)
                is however susceptible to oxidation to Fe(III). The complexes are often less stable than with Fe(III)
                due to
                lower charge of central metal ion. Most are octahedral and high spin, again unless the ligand is very
                strong, in which case low spin octahedral is preferred.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rarely above 6. 2 is surprisingly well favoured for transition metals.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cu(II) favours 4, 5 and 6. Geometry is hard to establish due to Jahn-Teller effect

<p class="c1"><span class="c3">CuI</span><span class="c5">2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;does not exist, as Iodide

<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Complexing &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">In water, Cu(II) more stable than Cu(I). Reason &ndash; smaller ion with higher

<p class="c1"><span class="c3">1</span><span class="c2">st</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;ionisation energies are far
                higher than Group 1 alkali metals due to d electrons being very poor shielders.</span></p>

                class="c2">rd</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;ionisation energies are much lower because a filled d shell
                is
                more easily disrupted than a p shell. Thus, they can reach oxidation states above +1.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Trends in Radii &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ionic radii are far smaller than Group 1 alkali metals due to d electrons being very

<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Trends in Oxidation States &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Au(V) is known for fluorides, but also rare.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ag favours +1 (due to having lowest ionisation energy of the 3 metals), Au favours +3
                (lowest total of IE1+IE2+IE3). Indicative of the fact that the three metals are not very closely related
                in
                properties.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Redox &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gold is the most electronegative metal. Can be reacted with group 1 metals and behave
                like a salt.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Near the bottom of the electrochemical series (unlike Group 1).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Very stable to reaction with air (close to platinum in their inertness). Silver

<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Structure of Oxides &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ag and Au do not bind to O as strongly as Cu, so they are less thermally

<p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Complexing &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">For Silver, Ag(I) is more stable than Ag(II). Silver is much larger than Cu so

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Au(V) exists with Fluoride ligand, octahedral anions.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ag(III) is quite stable with periodates and tellurate complexes.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Au(III) is most stable for gold, and isoelectronic to Pt(II). Usually square planar
                (orbitals easily split).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Au(II) rare &ndash; usually a mix of Au(I) and Au(III).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ag(II) are usually square planar and paramagnetic. High CFSE with 4d

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ag(I) is favoured. Doesn&rsquo;t bind well to oxygen (insoluble compounds) therefore
                soft (type b) metal. Prefers 2 coordinate linear complexes in this state as opposed to tetrahedra like
                Cu(I). This effect is also true for Au(I).</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Au will form a range of cluster compounds in preference to polymeric complexes. M-M
