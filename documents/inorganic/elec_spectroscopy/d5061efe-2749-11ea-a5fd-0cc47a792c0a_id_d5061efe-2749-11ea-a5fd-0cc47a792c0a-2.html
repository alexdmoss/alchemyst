Spectroscopic Term Symbols -
Spectroscopic Term Symbols are used in the same way as Atomic Term Symbols. Thus 4T1g has
a multiplicity of 4 (i.e. quartet state with S=3/2, as expected for three unpaired electrons in Cr3+).
The letter denotes the symmetry of the overall electronic orbital state. Centrosymmetric properties
are also incorporated here for Octahedral complexes. Hence, the rest of the term is T1g (triply
degenerate and gerade). For Cr3+, this would correspond to t2g2eg1, since there are 3 ways of
arranging this. Similarly, t2g3 would be A2g (not totally symmetric A1g though).
An Electronic Spectrum
This shows a typical spectrum. This is for the d3 complex [Cr(NH3)6]3+, and illustrates the features
of the rest of these notes - variation in width and magnification, and types of peak (Charge
Transfer vs. d-d Transitions).
Types of Transition
Most inorganic electronic spectra are measured in absorption, and thus involve the transitions of
electrons from occupied to empty orbitals.
Charge-Transfer Transitions involve ligand- and metal-based levels, and are classified as ligand-
to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), LMCT can occur in
all complexes including ones with empty or completely filled d shells. MLCT is seen in complexes
where the ligands have low-lying empty orbitals (e.g. CO and unsaturated ligands). It is also
possible to get intervalence transitions in “mixed valency compounds” such as KFeIIFeIII(CN)6.
Energies
Corresponds to between 3000 and 50000cm-1, 3000 to 200nm, or 0.4 to 6 eV. 14000cm-1 is red,
while 25000cm-1 is violet in the visible region.

The colour we see is that of the light transmitted or (in the case of solids) reflected. Light
absorbed generally “disappears” as the energy of an electronic excited state is rapidly converted
into vibrational energy (and hence ultimately heat); thus the wavelengths absorbed are those we
do not see. As transitions are often broad, the relationship between the energies of absorption
bands and the colours of a complex are sometimes not obvious.
Intensities
The Beer-Lambert Law governing the amount of radiation transmitted through a sample can be
rearranged to give:
log10(Io/I) = εcl.
Where Io is the incident and I the transmitting intensity, c the molar concentration of absorbing
species, l the path length, and ε is the molar extinction coefficient conventionally given in units of
M-1 cm-1. The maximum value of ε in a band, εmax, is a convenient guide to the absorption
intensity, although a better theoretical measure is the integrated value over the band.
The intensity of a transition is governed by selection rules.
Selection Rules
There are 3 Selection Rules to consider.
Angular Momentum:
∆l =
±1
Thus transitions that involve a change in quantum number by 1 (i.e. pÆd or dÆp, for instance)
are allowed. The important point here is that d-d transitions are not allowed.
Spin-multiplicity:
The spin selection rule ∆S = 0, specifies that there should be no change in the number of
unpaired electrons. Spin forbidden bands occur weakly through the mediation of spin-orbit
coupling.
Transitions between states of the same multiplicity are allowed. Thus, 2T to a 2E are allowed,
while 2T to 1T are not. For the electron to change its spin, energy must be expended and so any
spin forbidden transitions are usually very weak.
Spin-forbidden transitions are more intense in heavy atoms - larger spin-orbit coupling.
Laporte (parity):
Based on the symmetry of the complex. For centrosymmetric molecules, this forbids a transition
between energy levels with the same symmetry with respect to the centre of inversion. So
transitions such as T2gÆEg are not allowed.
The Laporte selection rule can be circumvented, either due to various ligands around the
molecule disrupting the perfect symmetry around the complex, or because the molecule can
vibrate to remove the centre of symmetry. The interaction between electronic and vibrational
modes is called vibronic coupling and means that d-d transitions are observed. However, they are
often not very intense due to energy expended in vibration. The intensity of vibronic bands
increases with temperature as vibrational amplitudes increase.
Note that there are several factors to consider here. Firstly, larger transition metals (2nd/3rd row)
cause a large splitting factor (∆) which makes the vibronic coupling more efficient.
Secondly, complexes with tetrahedral symmetry do not have a centre of inversion, which allows
easier mixing of levels to give more intense transitions. This is further magnified by the fact that
the t2 orbitals in Td complexes have the same symmetry as the (n+1)p orbitals, so eÆt2 has a

partly d-p character. This means that the Angular Momentum Selection Rule is also partly
satisfied,  making  the  intensity  even  stronger.  Note  however  that  some  d-d  transitions  in
tetrahedral complexes may be forbidden by symmetry-based selection rules: as in CoCl42- below.

Lanthanides and Actinides, with valence f orbitals, are more contracted and can be seen more as
free ion spectra than due to any ligand involvements. This leads to sharper and weaker peaks,
since there is weak interaction with the ligands, so more energy is required to cause vibrations or
more intense splittings (f-f transitions are of much weaker intensity than d-d). The ionic nature of
the lanthanides also increases the energy of Charge Transfers to UV (see below). Hence, the
lanthanides are usually pale or non-coloured.
Conversely, for 2nd and 3rd row metals, larger orbitals reduces electron repulsions and reduces
the value of B, the Racah Parameter. This gives higher energy transitions. Secondly, the lower
energy d-orbitals match better with the ligand orbital energies. This coupled with a better overlap
gives a larger value of ∆o.
More About Mechanisms for Intensity
Magnetic Dipole Intensity
In octahedral sites, pure d-d (and f-f) electronic transitions are forbidden by the Laporte Rule: but
the rule is an approximation, based on the dominance of the electric-dipole mechanism. The
radiation field also has a magnetic component, perpendicular to the electric component, which
can induce transitions between states connected by a magnetic-dipole transition moment. Such
transitions generate a rotational displacement of charge.
The 4A2g Æ 4T2g transition of Cr3+, d3, is allowed by this mechanism, because the magnetic-dipole
operator transforms as T1g in Oh.  At low temperatures absorption can only occur from the
electronic ground state, and the lowest energy transition is to the pure electronic excited state. All
transitions that create vibrational quanta will be at higher energy. In emission, downwards
transitions create vibrational energy and occur at lower energy than the pure electronic transition;
the only band common to both spectra is the pure electronic transition.

The magnetic-dipole mechanism is also required for natural optical activity, so the intensity of the
circular dichroism spectrum of the optical enantiomer (∆)-Cr(en)33+ is only large in the region
where the octahedral analogue has a 4A2g Æ 4T2g transition.
Vibronic Intensity
In  the
4A2g  Æ
4T2g   transition  of  CrCl63-,  vibrations  that  enable  the  electric-dipole  intensity
mechanism must have ungerade symmetry. In the octahedron there are three such modes, a t1u
stretch, a t1u bend and a t2u bend. To test whether the transition is allowed in this way, we
determine the overall symmetry of the vibronic states, formed from products of the electronic and
vibrational wavefunctions, and require that the direct product derived from these states contain
the invariant representation. This condition is satisfied for both types of ungerade mode in this
transition. The enabling modes are often said to provide ‘false origins’ in that they appear to be
the first significant transitions in absorption (being so much more intense than the magnetic-
dipole allowed pure electronic origin). Intensity enabled in this way is described as vibronic.
The rest of the envelope in the emission spectrum (as well as in absorption) is composed of
progressions in two other modes of the octahedron, the a1g symmetric stretch and the eg mode.
These modes cannot themselves enable intensity, but the creation of their quanta in the excited
state implies a distortion along their respective coordinates in the excited state equilibrium
geometry, and they occur in combination with the intensity enabling ungerade modes.
The activation of the eg mode is unusual and shows that the excited state has a Jahn-Teller
distortion created by the presence of one eg electron in the t2g2eg excited state configuration, as
well as the more usual uniform bond-lengthening implied by the progression in the a1g mode.
These properties of the excited state help to explain the mechanism of photochemically activated
substitution, which is a feature of Cr3+ coordination chemistry.
Widths
Electronic transitions are often accompanied by vibrational excitation. In some cases (especially
in spectra of solids measured at low temperatures) it may be possible to resolve progressions in
one or more vibrational modes, but spectra measure in solution are more often simply broadened
by unresolved vibrational structure. The extent of broadening can be related to the Franck-
Condon Principle and depends on the changes in equilibrium metal-ligand bond lengths resulting
from the transition. When there is very little change in the bonding character of the orbitals
involved, bands are fairly sharp; examples are f-f spectra and some spin-forbidden d-d bands. On
the other hand, charge-transfer transitions are often very broad, as they can involve a large
change in bonding.
d-d Transitions in Oh and Td Fields
The d electrons are treated as though they only occupy d orbitals on the metal. The effect of the
ligands is assumed small and comparable in magnitude to the repulsion between pairs of d
electrons. The spin-orbit coupling energy is usually small compared with these perturbations, in
the first transition series, but can be very significant in the 3rd transition series.
d-d Transitions: spin allowed
in an octahedral d1 complex, we expect one d-d transition from the
ground state t2g1 2T2g to the excited state eg1 2Eg. the transition energy
gives directly the value of the ligand field splitting parameter ∆ which
(for essentially historical reasons) is sometimes expressed in terms of
Dq, where ∆ = 10Dq. Thus we see one transition centred on 18000cm-1
in the spectrum of [Ti(H2O)6]3+, although it is broad and asymmetrical,
apparently   because   the   excited   state   undergoes   a   Jahn-Teller
distortion. Note also the strong charge-transfer band above 25000cm-1.

Weak and Strong Field Limits
For most dn configurations the situation is more complicated because several states can arise.
Consider d2. There are two approaches. In the strong-field approach we consider the different
configurations of t2g and eg electrons. Group-theoretical arguments predict the following states:
t2g2
gives
3T1g, 1A1g, 1Eg and 1T2g.
t2g1eg1   gives
3T1g, 3T2g, 1T1g and 1T2g.
eg2
gives
3A2g, 1A1g and 1Eg.
The different states from a given configuration differ in energy because of different degrees of
electron repulsion. From Hund’s first rule we expect 3T1g to be the ground state; as there are
three other triplet states we expect to find three spin-allowed transitions, as well as several much
weaker spin-forbidden transitions to the singlet states. The strong field limit implies that the ligand
field is so strong that electron-electron repulsions can be ignored and energies can be expressed
solely in terms of ∆o.
In the alternative weak field method we start from the states of the free ion with the d2 electron
configuration. Initially ignore the ligand field and find the energies of the free ion terms - this is an
atomic problem. Then consider the effect of the ligand field on these terms. We can show that this
configuration gives rise to 3F and 3P states as well as several singlets. The weak field limit implies
that ∆o is so weak that only electron-electron repulsions are important and the relative energies of
the terms can be expressed as combinations of Racah Parameters.
The energy difference between the states comes again from different electron repulsions. From
Hund’s first and second rules we expect 3F to be the lowest. Again using group theory, we find
that in an octahedral ligand field the following triplet states are predicted:
3
F
gives
3T1g, 3T2g and 3A2g
3P
gives
3T1g
Note that the symmetries of the states are the same in both approaches. As only one state each
symmetry of 3A2g and 3T2g is found, their wavefunctions must also be the same. However the two
3T
1g states are mixed together by the combined effects of electron repulsion and ligand field
splitting, and the strong-field wavefunctions will be linear combinations of those arising in the
weak-field method. The correlation between the states arising in the two approaches is shown in
the diagram:

Weak (ligand) field:
i.e. e2/r
12 > ∆.
Strong (ligand) field:
i.e. ∆ > e2/r12.
Term Energies for d2
The terms arising from the 3d2 configuration are 1S, 3P, 1D, 3F, and 1G. We calculate the term
energies as follows. If |A> is a many electron wavefunction formed from the product of one-
electron functions, we need the average value of the inter-electron repulsion energy:
12
e
e2/r12, =
A* Adτ
dτ
,
∫∫
1
2
r
12
which weights the repulsion energy by the probability that the electrons will be separated by the
distance r12.
The only difficulty in the theory of electron-electron repulsion (or of electron-ligand repulsion), is
the awkwardness associated with the fact that the energy is associated with the distance r12,
which is not simply related to the coordinates in which the wavefunctions are cast. So 1/r12 must
be expressed in those coordinates.
Racah parameters come from the method of defining this in the wavefunctions coordinates
(actually from the Fn parameters used to adjust to fit the spectrum). With Racah parameters, only
B is needed to specify the separation between the ground state and the first excited state with the
same spin multiplicity. Since these transitions are spin-allowed, B alone can describe the
electron-electron repulsion energy of those excited states that appear intense in the spectrum.
The effect of increasing Zeff on a set of 3d2 gaseous ions is that, as the average radii decrease,
the mean distance between them also decreases as does their repulsion. Hence there is a
relative increase in the parameters B and C, but the relative spacing of the terms is unchanged,
because the angular disposition of the electrons is unaffected by the orbital contraction. When a
4d2 ion is compared, the separation between excited states decreases by about 25%. This shows
the increase in average electron radius in the 4d-shell. In the 5d shell, B and C decrease further.
In practice C ≈ 4B, so approximating the position of all the terms requires just one parameter.
Spin-Orbit Coupling (splits states with S and L ≠ 0)
Spin-Orbit coupling constant, ξ. ξ is proportional to Zeff4. Qualitatively the origin of the strong
dependence on Zeff is due to the small average value of the radius of the electron when Zeff is
large, and the strong magnetic field associated with orbital motion close to a nucleus with a high
charge.
Spectroscopic Consequences of the Spin-Orbit Interaction
(i)
Admixture of states differing in S, allows ‘spin forbidden transitions’, especially in
heavy metal atoms. So these are often observed in the 3rd Transition Series.

Effect of the Ligand Field on the Free Ion Terms
Example: d2, 3F (the ground term) in the Oh field.
We want to find how this splits up in the presence of the ligands. Use the 7 ML components from
L=3 as a basis for representing the operations of Oh. Work out the characters and reduce them. A
general solution exists in the full rotation group, R3, for a rotation of angle φ.
The result for L = 3 tells us the Oh states for 3F (A2g, T2g, T1g) but not their relative energies. These
are found by extrapolation to the strong field limit, observing the non-crossing rule. At this limit
where,  by  definition,  the  electron-electron  repulsion  is  ignored,  there  are  three  electron-
configurations, t2g2, t2geg, and eg2, with energies, which being the sum of the individual electron
energies are -8Dq, +2Dq, and +12Dq respectively.
Group theory tells us how to find the triplet states in these configurations, using the direct product
of the individual electron symmetries. Because the spin part of a triplet wavefunction is symmetric
with respect to a permutation of coordinates, the spatial part must be antisymmetric, and for the
t2g2, and eg2 configurations we therefore require the antisymmetric direct product. There is no
such restriction for the t2geg configuration. The results are t2g2 Æ 3T1g, t2geg Æ 3T1g, 3T2g and eg2 Æ
3A2g.
It is now possible to construct the correlation diagram connecting the weak and strong field limits.
The interconnections for the 3T1 states are made unambiguous by the non-crossing rule.
Orgel Diagrams
Similar theory may be applied to other dn configurations and the results needed for spin-allowed
transitions from high-spin ground states are summarised in Orgel Diagrams. The diagrams are
applicable to tetrahedral as well as octahedral fields, using the principle that the d orbital splitting
pattern of one is the reverse of the other.
These provide a summary of the splitting of the ground free-ion terms in the various cubic fields
as well as excited terms with the same spin multiplicity. Because there is a simple relationship
between dn and d10-n cases, and also between tetrahedral and octahedral fields, just two of these
diagrams are needed.
Example: d2, d8
The free ion term energies for these configurations are identical. The angular momentum of the
d8 ion can be considered to arise from two positively charged ‘holes’ in the closed d10 shell (which
has no angular momentum). The terms that arise from this angular moment, and the repulsion
energy between the holes, are just the same as for two electrons. However the strong field
diagram for d8 is different. In the octahedral field the configurations are t2g6eg2, t2g5eg3, t2g4eg4.
Applying the same methods as for d2, there is only one triplet state compatible with t2geg2, namely
3A
2g (notice the absence of any orbital degeneracy in the half-filled eg set). The d8 correlation
diagram that we get like this is:

Notice how the crossing implied by the dotted lines has been avoided in the actual 3T1 states
whose energies are shown by the full lines. Compared to the d2 ion the ligand field splitting of the
free ion terms has been reversed. We can interpret this as the action of the ligands on the two
‘holes’ in the filled d10 shell. Because they are positively charged, the sign of the splitting is
inverted. This result is even simpler for d1 and d9, but is generally true for all high-spin dn and d10-n
ions.
Now replace the octahedral field by the tetrahedral field. The strong field side of all the correlation
diagrams inverts because the splitting of the t2 and e orbitals inverts. Taken with the relationship
between dn and d10-n, this means that the same diagram will describe dn in an octahedron to be
plotted with either sign relative to the free ion term energies, which means that it can describe the
four possible combinations of dn and d10-n ions in tetrahedral and octahedral fields.
Only two Orgel Diagrams are needed to describe most of the states of interest of all the high-spin
dn ions. We can see why by finding the free-ion ground terms for each dn, but applying Hund’s
Rules 1 and 2, and using the highest value for ML got by summing the values of the individual ml
values.
We notice the symmetry of dn and d10-n. Because S does not split in the ligand field, we only need
two Orgel diagrams to cover the D or F/P cases. To check on the sign of the splitting, the
symmetry of the ground terms in the strong field limit can be found, using group theory in the
manner described previously. With this information the Orgel diagrams can be constructed
unambiguously. We have ignored d5 which has no excited states with S = 5/2, and so all its d-d
transitions are spin-forbidden.
d1 / d9 case:
From this, it can be seen that d1 (right hand side) has a Ground State of T2. This implies the t2g
energy level.

- 9 -
Thus, for d1, there is a single transition from t2g to eg, written as 2EgÅ2T2g. The energy gap
corresponds to 1∆o. The spectra would appear as a single peak, perhaps with some peak-splitting
due to Jahn-Teller distortions. However, d9 (left hand side) has a ground state of E, which
corresponds to the eg level.
Increasing the number of d-electrons:
It can be seen from these that d2 and d8 show several transitions, while d4 is only one.
Note also that there is repulsion (bending) between the lines of the same symmetry. This
prevents crossing over (non-crossing rule).
d4 - 5T2gÅ5Eg at ∆o is the only transition, but there will be Jahn-Teller distortions in 5Eg.
d2 - Several transitions each corresponding to a peak. They are:
3A
2gÅT1g(F) at 1.8∆o.
3T2gÅT1g(F) at 0.8∆o.
3T
1g(P) ÅT1g(F). Value here would be dependent on the Racah Parameter.
d8 - three transitions again.
3T2gÅ3A2g at ∆o.
3T1g(F) Å3A2g. Would be at 1.8∆o, but repulsions (bending) alters value.
3T
1g(P) Å3A2g. This is again Racah dependent.
Hole Formalism
This states that the number of ways of arranging one electron is 2 x (2l+1) states.
Consider comparison of d1 and d9:
Thus there is only one possible transition for each configuration, i.e. they have the same terms.
Mathematically, this makes use of the nCr function as 10C1 = 10C9 = 10. Thus it is a general trend
that dn has the same terms as d10-n. However, J values are reversed, and energy varies due to
shielding differences.

Examples
1.
[Fe(H2O)6]2+, Fe2+ has the d6 configuration. The appropriate diagram shows the splitting of
a free-ion D state into two states, the lower T2 and the upper E. the spin multiplicity is not
given but we can work this out as high-spin d6 states must have four unpaired electrons,
hence S = 2 and 2S+1 = 5. the full designations of the states are 5T2g (which in the
strong-field approach comes from the t2g4eg2 configuration) and 5Eg (from t2g3eg3). We
expect one spin-allowed transition, which is seen at around 10000cm-1.
2.
[CoCl4]2-. Co2+ has d7, and we use the other diagram, this time in the “backwards”
direction from the scale on the bottom. There are three unpaired electrons so that 2S+1 =
4 and the states are 4A2 (the ground state), 4T1, 4T2 and 4T1. there are three spin-allowed
transitions, which are expected to be more intense than in an octahedral complex.
However group-theoretical selection rules tell us that only transitions to T1 states are
allowed in Td symmetry from an A2 ground state. The transition to 4T2 is therefore only
vibronically allowed and is considerably weaker.
The most important conclusions to be drawn from Orgel Diagrams concerns the number of spin-
allowed d-d transitions expected in high-spin octahedral and tetrahedral complexes. These are
summarised:
Configuration
Number of Transitions
d1, d4, d6, d9
One
d2, d3, d7, d8
Three
d5
None
Note the following limitations of these predictions:
a)   the expected transitions may not all be seen, either because they are off the scale of the
spectrometer (e.g. in the IR) or because the are obscured by much stronger charge-
transfer transitions.
b)   The predictions apply to regular Oh and Td symmetries. When the symmetry is lower the
d levels split further and more transitions may be seen.
d-d transitions: spin forbidden
Note also the result for high-spin d5. The 6A1g ground state from the t2g3eg2 configuration is the
only state with five unpaired electrons and so all d-d transitions are spin forbidden. In many other
cases spin-forbidden transitions are also possible, but generally they are weak and hard to see.
The spectrum of MnF2 which has the rutile structure with octahedral Mn2+ is shown. The
intensities are much weaker than for spin-allowed d-d spectra.
Tanabe Sugano Diagrams
These are quantitative version of Orgel diagrams. The relative energies of all the states depends
on the relative magnitude of Dq and B, so these diagrams plot the relative energies (in units of B)
of the states as a function of the ratio Dq/B. Unlike Orgel diagrams all free ion states are included,
and all energies appear relative to the ground state. If the ground state changes, e.g. if Dq is
large enough to cause spin-pairing, there is a discontinuity in the slopes of all the lines.

The curvature of the lines indicates the interaction between free ion states under the influence of
the field. An approximate method of finding the parameters from a spectrum is to fit the ratios of
the energies of the transitions to a vertical section through this diagram. This fit determines Dq/B,
while a comparison of any one transition energy with the vertical scale establishes B. Then both
parameters are known.
The main limitations of the diagram are:
1)   It excludes spin-orbit interaction, and
2)   It assumes that B is a good parameter for all the states.
There are two approximations for all the states. There are two approximations in this. First it
assumes C/B ~ 4.5, so that the energy of the spin-forbidden states can be determined. More
subtly, the free ion electron-electron repulsion parameters assume the same average radius of all
d electrons. But in a complex the degree of covalent bonding of the t2g and eg orbitals is different.
The electron-electron repulsion is therefore different for two t2g electrons, two eg electrons or
between a t2g and an eg electron, and the simple theory is quantitatively unreliable. The errors can
be pronounced if the electrons are delocalised, e.g. into an unsaturated π-system on the ligand.
To interpret spin-forbidden transitions such as the ones above for MnF2 we need a Tanabe-
Sugano diagram like those shown below. Note that unlike the case with an Orgel diagram, the
ground state energy is drawn at zero. In the weak-field approach the free ion ground state is 6S
which gives the single 6A1g state in the octahedral field. All other states shown are quartets with
only three unpaired electrons. The different slopes of lines in the diagram are important.
Lines sloping downwards on the diagram correspond to excited states from the t2g4eg1
configuration. They are of higher energy than the ground state because the spin-pairing
energy is greater than ∆.
Lines almost horizontal on the diagram correspond to excited states of the same
configuration as the ground state. Their energy is therefore independent of ∆. Because
there is no change at all in the bonding character of the occupied orbitals, these
transitions are sharp.
Lines sloping upwards on the diagram correspond to states from the t2g2eg3 configuration.

Curving of the lines is due to mixing of terms of the same symmetry type. Still obey non-crossing
rule though (bend apart instead).
Spectrochemical and Nephelauxetic Series
Analysis  of  d-d  energies  allow  the  determination  of  two  types  of  parameter:  ligand  field
parameters represent the splitting of the d orbitals; electrostatic parameters represent the
repulsions between electrons in d orbitals and give the energy differences between different
terms from the same configuration.
For octahedral and tetrahedral complexes only one ligand field parameter is needed, ∆ = 10Dq.
For a given metal ion and different ligands, values of ∆ follow the order:
I-< Br- < S2- < SCN- < Cl- < NO3- < F- < OH- < H2O < NCS- < NH3 < bipy < NO2- < CN- < CO
This Spectrochemical series of ligands reflects their different bonding properties, the order being:
Weak σ-donor, π-donor < moderate σ-donor < strong σ-donor, π-acceptor.
For a given ligand the corresponding Spectrochemical series of metal ions follows another
pattern. There is a general increase in ∆ with increasing oxidation state, and a strong increase
from 3d to 4d and 5d. within a series ∆ tends to decrease from left to right as the d orbitals
contract and overlap less well with ligands.
Remember that the Spectrochemical series is largely unrelated to the expectations of the
electrostatic model. Even with good metal wavefunctions the magnitude of 10Dq, calculated with
a point charge or point dipole model for the ligand, is about 10 times too small compared to
experiment. The missing feature is overlap and MO formation. The most direct evidence for this
is:
(a) the distribution of spin density seen by neutron diffraction, and
(b) hyperfine structure in EPR, where the resonances of unpaired spins, nominally in metal d
orbitals, contain fine structure from interaction with the nuclear spin of the ligands.
Electron repulsion between electrons in d orbitals can be expressed in terms of three Racah
parameters A, B and C which depend on complicated integrals over the radial distribution. Energy
differences between different terms of a configuration depend only on B and C. for example the
energy difference between the free ion F and P terms of highest multiplicity in d2, d3, d7 and d8 is
15B; C is also needed for spin-forbidden transitions but generally the analysis is simplified by
assuming a fixed ratio of C ≈ 4B.
B may be determined for free transition metal ions from analysis of their spectra. It is found that
values obtained from analysis of spectra of complexes are invariably smaller than for free ions.
This is known as the Nephelauxetic effect (from the Greek meaning “cloud expanding”) and
reflects the fact that what we call “d orbitals” in complexes are really molecular orbitals involving
the ligands as well. The decrease in repulsion arises because electrons in these molecular
orbitals are on average further apart than in true d orbitals. It can be quantified by the
Nephelauxetic ratio:
β = Bcomplex / Bfree ion.
Values of β depend on the metal and the ligand, and for the same metal ion follow the
Nephelauxetic series of ligands:
F- > H2O > NH3 > Cl- > CN- > Br- > I-

The series reflects the different degrees of covalency found in the metal-ligand bond. This
accounts for the difference in electron repulsions between the free ion and a complex. The
weakening occurs for the complex because the occupied molecular orbitals delocalise over the
ligands and away from the metal.
A small β indicates a large measure of d-electron delocalisation on to the ligand and hence a
significant covalent character in the complex.
The nephelauxetic parameter also depends on the location of the electrons. In eg the overlap of s
is usually larger than the p overlap of t2g, so the cloud expansion is larger for eg.
Jahn-Teller Distortions
Indicated by metal-ligand bond lengths not being equal. Is explained by perturbation occurring
when  there  are  degenerate  sets  of  orbitals,  such  that  the  degeneracy  is  removed.  The
consequence is elongation / compression of bonds. Greatest change in length is observed for the
orbitals lying on the same axis as the ligands (eg for Oh).
Thus, in the extreme it is possible to see additional absorption bands in the UV-visible spectra
due to reduction in symmetry. Usually though, a splitting of peaks or asymmetric peaks are seen.
Examples - Transition Metal Aquo Ions
The sensitivity of the eye is from 15,000cm-1 (red) to 25,000cm-1 (violet). A strong absorption band
in the red part of the spectrum will make the sample appear blue. A strong absorption band in the
blue region makes the sample appear yellow. The eye sees colours from the gaps in the
spectrum.
d1, Ti(H
2O)63+.
The absorption in the green, with red and blue transmission gives a purple colour. The presence
of two peaks, separated by about 2000cm-1, is peculiar. The spin-orbit coupling constant for Ti3+
is 150cm-1 and its action in the 2T2g ground state, which alone has orbital angular momentum, is
too small to explain the splitting. Instead it is attributed to a Jahn-Teller effect in the Eg excited
state, in which the single eg electron creates the same distortion as the eg3 configuration does in

the ground state of Cu2+. The two peaks represent vertical transitions to the two potential energy
surfaces, which arise from this effect. We can deduce that 10Dq ~ 20,300cm-1.
d3, Cr(H2O)63+.
The solution is purple. The observed transition are: 4A2 Æ 4T2, 17,000cm-1 (ε=16); 4A2 Æ 4T1(F).
24000cm-1 (ε=18); 4A2 Æ 4T1(P), 37000cm-1 (weak). Assignment is simple because from the Orgel
or Tanabe-Sugano diagrams the first transition energy is 10Dq, and the other two transitions give
B = 695cm-1 (free ion 1030cm-1). Note the nephelauxetic effect and the weakness of the “two-
electron” 4A2 Æ 4T1 (P) transition.
d5, Mn2+.
Pale pink. All transitions are spin-forbidden. The Tanabe-Sugano diagram for this configuration
shows two types of line. Horizontal lines occur for those states which are derived from the t2g3eg2
configuration; their energies are dependent on the electron-electron repulsion parameters, but are
independent of 10Dq. Since there is no change in orbital occupation in these transitions, there is
no change in the equilibrium bond length in the excited state. The transitions are sharp because
vertical
(Franck-Condon) transitions conserve the vibrational quantum number, i.e.
∆v = 0.
Sloping lines correspond to configurations such as t2g4eg1, which become more stable relative to
the ground state as 10Dq increases. Here the bond lengths shorten in the excited state, and the
transitions are broad because Franck-Condon transitions occur between displaced vibrational
potential surfaces.
f-f Transitions
f-f transitions in lanthanide complexes are weak and sharp and have energies close to those
expected for free lanthanide ions. Together with the magnetic properties, this confirms that 4f
orbitals have very little overlap with surrounding atoms. High-resolution spectra measured in
crystals at low temperatures do show small ligand field splittings but they are small (of the order
of 10cm-1) compared with splittings in transition metal complexes.
Actinides show larger ligand field effects than lanthanides, especially ions early in the series (e.g.
U4+). The interpretation of spectra is complicated by strong spin-orbit splitting.
f-f transitions in centrosymmetric complexes are Laporte forbidden as with d-d spectra. Intensities
are in the order 4f < 5f < d reflecting the order of strength of metal-ligand interactions.
Charge Transfer Transitions
Can be ligand to metal, metal to ligand, and intervalence charge transfer (metal to metal) in mixed
valence  systems.  The  occurrence  of  these  is  very  widespread.  Famous  examples  are
Fe(SCN)62+ (blood red), Fe(phen)32+ (blood red), and Prussian Blue, which are respectively
examples of ligand to metal, metal to ligand metal to metal charge transfer.
These transitions are typified by compounds such as MnO4-, where there are no d electrons, yet
this appears as a deep purple colour.
Ligand-to-metal transitions occur in all complexes, not only transition metals. In complexes with d-
d transitions LMCT transitions can often be seen at higher energy and identified by their much
stronger intensity. Sometimes they obscure some of the predicted d-d bands. In d0 complexes
such as MnO4- they are the only transitions seen. LMCT can be regarded as an internal redox
transition, the metal being reduced and the ligand oxidised. It is therefore possible to correlate
LMCT energies with the redox properties of metals and ligands. The comparison of two metal
ions with the same ligands is shown below. Lowering the energy of empty metal orbitals gives an
ion that is more easily reduced hence more strongly oxidising and is expected to correlate with a
lower LMCT energy.

- 15 -
For a given ligand LMCT transitions generally follow the trends below:
(i)
Increase 3d < 4d < 5d as oxidising power decreases.
(ii)
Decrease with metal oxidation state.
(iii)
Decrease from left to right along the series as Zeff increases.
Exceptions to trend (iii) sometimes occur when there is a change of electron configuration.
Diagram shows order of transitions
(smallest energy first). For
3d transition metals these
transitions are usually at much higher energy than d-d transitions (UV end of spectrum).
Variation with Metal -
Ability to receive or release electrons is obviously dependent on electron configuration. If the
metal has a full t2g then Ligand to Metal Charge Transfer will have to put electrons into the
antibonding eg, which is likely to be very high in energy. Similarly, for the classic MnO4-, the d-
orbitals are empty so an electron is easily transferred into the lowest energy orbitals.
From this, it is obvious that Ligand to Metal Charge Transfer is more likely to occur for high
oxidation state (low d electron count) metals. Similarly, Metal to Ligand Charge Transfer would
require many d-electrons, and vacant orbitals on the ligand to receive them (usually π*).
Comparing metals with different oxidation states, for a higher oxidation state, the d-orbitals are
lower in energy, since the increased charge of the nucleus stabilises them. Thus, the energy gap
is reduced, and the Transition Energy is lower.
Moving down a Group, 4d and 5d transition metals, the 4d and 5d orbitals are higher in energy
and so the Transition Energy is increased.
Moving across the Period, the d-orbitals decrease in energy, reducing the Transition Energy.
However, d-electrons are increasingly populating these orbitals, and this can have important

- 16 -
consequences. For example, the energy of transition for Pd is higher than for Ru because the
electron has to enter an eg orbital instead of t2g, so the energy gap is larger.
Variation with Ligands
Comparing Ligands, again orbital energy is the key to the transition energies. For example, down
the halides, their non-bonding orbitals increase in energy, giving:
Thus, the Transition Energy will decrease for lower halides.
The overall picture for Transition Energies can be summed up in the following diagram:
These processes resemble redox reactions drive by photons, which transfer electrons between
atoms. The energies nicely follow the expected redox properties. For a given metal ion, LMCT
energies reflect the redox properties of the ligand. A lower LMCT energy corresponds to a more
easily oxidising ligand. Thus FeF3 is light green, because the F and Fe charge transfer occurs in
the ultraviolet. However, the colours of FeCl3
(brown) and FeBr3 (red-black) and the non-
existence of FeI3, are indicative of a progressive lowering of the charge transfer energy which
eventually becomes possible thermally. There are many examples, e.g. HgCl2 (white), HgBr2
(yellow), HgI2 (red).
Most of the colours used in analytical chemistry are charge transfer transitions, because their
high intensity enables the determination of very small concentrations of material. Examples are
the use of Ni(IV) in an oxidised dimethylglyoximate complex, which is red, and the determination
of platinum metals using sulphur-containing ligands. Apart from Prussian blue, the mixed iron
oxides (black), Ag(I)Ag(III)O2 (brown-black), and Cs2Au(I)Au(III)Cl6 are good examples of mixed
valence species.
Energies
If the orbitals are substantially of one-centre in type, the charge-transfer energies are closely
related to the sum of the ionisation energy of the donor centre and the electron-affinity of the
acceptor centre.
•   The well defined shifts for the series CoX42- and NiX42- shows the difference between the
halides as well as the more oxidising properties of Ni(II) as compared to Co(II) consistent
with their effective nuclear charge.
•   The series of compounds with the formula Co(NH3)5X2+ demonstrate how large the
changes in charge transfer energies are compared to the shifts due to the difference in
their ligand field parameters.
•   Changes in the metal can have a similarly profound influence. It has been shown that the
energy decreases with increasing formal charge on the metal. Higher energies in the

second and third transition series reflect the well-known increase in stability of higher
oxidation states of these metals.
EXAMPLE:
a)   LMCT energies of d0 oxoanions follow the orders:
VO43- > CrO42- > MnO4-
MnO4- < TcO4- < ReO4-
b)   LMCT energies of some [MCl6]2- complexes of 5d series metals follow the order:
[OsCl6]2- > [IrCl6]2- < [PtCl6]2-
The ground state electron configurations in these low-spin complexes are t2g4, t2g5, t2g6
respectively. In the first two an electron can be excited into a t2g orbital and the order
follows the expected trend with increasing Zeff. However in the [PtCl6]2- the t2g orbitals are
full and the transition is into the higher energy eg which leads to a reversal of the normal
trend.
EXAMPLE:
The energies of LMCT bands of some tetrahedral Co2+ complexes follow the order:
[CoCl4]2- > [CoBr4]2- > [CoI4]2-
as expected from the ease of oxidation of Cl- < Br- < I-.
Metal-to-ligand charge transfer occurs in complexes where the ligands have empty antibonding
orbitals at relatively low energy, for example in carbonyls and with O and N-donor ligands
attached to unsaturated π-systems. Generally they follow the reverse order expected for LMCT,
e.g. there is an increase in energy as the metal Zeff increases, because the ions are less easily
oxidised.
