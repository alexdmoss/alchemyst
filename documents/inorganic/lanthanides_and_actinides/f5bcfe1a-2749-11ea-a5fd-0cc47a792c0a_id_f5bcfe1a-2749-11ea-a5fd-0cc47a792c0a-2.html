Principal Characteristics of the Rare Earth Elements
1.   Occur together in nature, in minerals, e.g. monazite (a mixed rare earth phosphate).
2.   Very similar chemical properties. Found combined with non-metals largely in the 3+
oxidation state, with little tendency to variable valence.
3.   Small difference in solubility / complex formation etc. of M3+ are due to size effects.
Traversing the series r(M3+) steadily decreases - the lanthanide contraction.
Difficult   to   separate   and   differentiate,   e.g.   in
1911   James   performed
15000
recrystallisations to get pure Tm(BrO3)3!
f-Orbitals
The Effective Electron Potential:
•   Large angular momentum for an f-orbital (l = 3).
•   Large centrifugal potential tends to keep the electron away from the nucleus.
o   Aufbau order.
•   Increased Z increases Coulombic attraction to a larger extent for smaller n due to a
proportionately greater change in Zeff.
o   Reasserts Hydrogenic order.
This can be viewed empirically as due to differing penetration effects.
Radial Wavefunctions Pn,l2 for 4f, 5d, 6s in Ce
4f orbitals (and the atoms in general) steadily contract across the lanthanide series.
Effective electron potential for the excited states of Ba {[Xe] 6s 4f} & La {[Xe] 6s 5d 4f} show a
sudden change in the broadness & depth of the 4f "inner well".
For Ba (Z = 56) 4f is an outer orbital with 4f close to its value for the H atom.
For La (Z = 57) 4f is an inner orbital with 4f ca. 0.7ao.

Though only for the next atom, Ce (Z = 58) is the 4f electron of sufficiently high binding energy to
appear in the ground state configuration.
Which Elements are d-block or f-block?
Most current Periodic tables have:-
¾   La as first 5d transition element
¾   Ac as first 6d transition element
Reasons?
Possibly erroneous (early) interpretation of atomic spectra - misleading electronic configurations?
Some ground state electronic configurations:
Calcium [Ar]4s2
Scandium [Ar]4s23d1
Strontium [Kr]5s2
Yttrium [Kr]5s24d1
Barium [Xe]6s2
Lanthanum [Xe]6s25d1
Ytterbium [Xe]6s24f14
Lutetium [Xe]6s24f145d1
Radium [Rn]7s2
Actinium [Rn]7s26d1
Nobelium [Rn]7s25f14
Lawrencium [Rn]7s25f146d1
In each case: differentiation by (n-1)d1 - as expected for the start of a transition series.
Lutetium and Lawrencium are just as good candidates to be the first elements of the 3rd and 4th
transition series as Lanthanum and Actinium.
Some suggestions why Lu might best regarded as the first 5d transition element.
¾   Periodic Trends in Various Properties.
¾   Structures of Metal, Metal Sesquioxide (M2O3) and Metal Chloride (MCl3).
¾   Similarities for Sc, Y, Lu.
¾   Differences from La.

THE LANTHANIDES
Abundance & Distribution
•   Not especially Rare(!), except Promethium which is produced artificially, e.g. La, Ce & Nd
are more common than Pb.
•   Most-common minerals:
monazite (mixed La, Th, Ln phosphates) - widely-distributed, concentrated in sand &
river beds due to relative insolubility.

bastnaesite (a La, Ln fluorocarbonate MIIICO3F) - a vast deposit in Sierra Nevada, USA.
•   Abundance of lanthanides in nature. Shows even-odd alternation with atomic number
mirrored by several/few alternation of number of stable isotopes with even/odd Z.
Extraction
The extraction of the Lanthanides from minerals by:
¾   Alkali Digestion of Monazite/Xenotime.
Monazite and Xenotime can also be opened-out through an Acid Route
¾   Acid Dissolution of Bastnaesite
Separation
2/3 of world production is actually used mixed in the proportions occurring naturally in the ore.
1. Cerium & Europium may be extracted Chemically:
Oxidise only Ce to M4+ by HClO or KMnO4, then precipitate as CeO2 or Ce(IO3)4.
On action of Zn/Hg only Eu forms a stable M2+ that doesn't reduce H2O, then isolate
by
precipitation as EuSO4.
2. Separation by Fractionation:
Small Scale methods used originally:
•   Fractional Crystallization of e.g. Ln(NO3)3.2NH4NO3.4H2O or Ln(BrO3)3
•   Fractional Thermal Decomposition of e.g. Ln(NO3)3
Current Small Scale Lab Separation:
•   Ion-Exchange Displacement Column
Ln3+(aq) are strongly adsorbed by a cation-exchange
resin, add a ligand, typically chelating, e.g. EDTA.
Ligand  binds  most  strongly  to  smallest  ion,  e.g.  the
binding constants of the Ln(EDTA) complexes (right).
Current Large Scale Industrial Separation:
Solvent Extraction
Ln3+(aq) is extracted in a continuous counter-current process into a non-polar organic liquid (e.g.
kerosene).
Solubility of Ln3+ in organic solvent increases with its relative atomic mass.
The Metals
Production of Elemental Metals
La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Gd:
2MCl3 + 3Ca Æ 2M + 3CaCl2 (T > 1000°C)
Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Y:
2MF3 + 3Ca Æ 2M + 3CaF2 (MCl3 is too volatile)

- 4 -
Pm:
PmF3 + 3 Li Æ Pm + 3LiF
Eu, Sm, Yb:
M2O3 + 2La Æ 2M + La2O3 (MCl3 reduced to MCl2 by Ca)
Mischmetall (mixed light Ln) :
electrolysis of fused LnCl3/NaCl with graphite anode & graphite or steel cathode.
Structures of Elemental Metals
Properties of the Metals
Silvery white, but tarnish in air.
Rather soft (later M are harder).
High mp & bp.
Very reactive: (I1 + I2 + I3) comparatively low.
Burn easily in air, but slowly in cold. Burn at T > 150 °C.
Exothermic reaction with H2 Æ MHn (n = 2,3, often results in defect states).
React readily with C, N2, Si, P, halogens & other non-metals.
Form binaries on heating with most non-metals (e.g. LnN, Ln2S3, LnB6, LnC2, ...).
Uses of Metals
<1% Mischmetall or Ln silicides improves strength & workability of low alloy steels for plate and
pipes (also used in Mg alloys).
Mischmetall (50% Ce, 25% La, 25% other light lanthanides) is pyrophoric - alloyed with 30% Fe it
is used in lighter flints.
Oxidation State Preferences
Chemistry is principally of Ln3+.
Examine Thermodynamic Parameters: Ionisation Energies, Heats of Hydration and Atomisation.
Ionization
For any given Lanthanide:
  As successive electrons are removed from neutral Ln
the stabilizing effect on the orbitals is related to their
principal quantum number, 4f > 5d > 6s.
  For Ln2+ (except for La & Gd) the configuration is
[Xe]4fn
  For Ln3+ the configuration is always [Xe]4fn
  The 4f binding energy is so great that remaining 4f
electrons are regarded as "core-like" (i.e. incapable
of modification by chemical means), except Ce.
Therefore  in  almost  all  cases  Ln3+  provides  the  best
energetics:
Observing trends across the Lanthanide Series:
•   The general trend is for increasing ionization energies
with increasing Z (i.e. with increase in Zeff)
•   Marked Half-Shell Effects - magnitude  as n in In

•   Also Quarter/Three-Quarter Shell Effects (compare with transition metals - these are not seen
clearly with dn configurations).
Explanation:
Inter-electronic repulsion is related not just to electron pairing but also to angular momentum of
the electrons.
e.g. in Pr2+ (4f3) Æ Pr3+ (4f2) ionization removes repulsion between e- of like rotation, whereas
Pm2+ (4f4) Æ Pm3+ (4f3) removes the stronger repulsion between e- of unlike rotation (latter
Ionization Energy is correspondingly lower - hence the local minimum in the I3 graph at Pm).
The three-quarter effect is the bigger: interelectronic repulsion is bigger in smaller Lnn+
Atomization
∆atmH follows the inverse trend to I3, and therefore also to (I1 + I2 + I3).
Metallic bonding is correlated with ease of ionization to Ln3+ state.
This trend is modified slightly due to the different structures of the Ln metals.
Some Thermodynamic Observations (Ionic Model style)
The trends in the formation of LnIII Compounds, ∆fH for LnX3(s) or Ln3+(aq) [ E°(Ln3+(aq) / Ln(s)) ]
depends on the balance between:
Energy Supplied to effect:
Ln(s) Æ Ln(g) Æ Ln3+(g) + 3e- [ ∆atmH + I1 + I2 + I3 ]
vs.
Energy gained from:
Ln3+(g) + 3X-(g) Æ LnX3(s) [ ∆LH(LnX3(s)) ]
or Ln3+(g) Æ Ln3+(aq) [∆hydH(Ln3+)]
The energies determining trends in E°(Ln3+(aq)/Ln(s)) are graphed below:
Production of Ln3+(g) shows:
•   A smooth trend based on size effects (trend based on Zeff).
•   Shell structure effects superimposed with clear maxima at half-shell (f7) and full-shell (f14).
•   Also smaller quarter and three-quarter shell effects.
Hydration Energy of Ln3+ (also Lattice Energies of LnX3(s)) shows:
•   Only a smooth ionic-size-based trend (the trend based on Zeff) and no shell structure
effects.
•   Balance of trends in Ionization + Atomization Energies with Hydration (Lattice) Energy
removes size effects.
•   Leaves only the Shell effects - see values of ∆fH(Ln3+(aq)).

Overall:
The most important energy correlations are with I3
Exceptions to +3 rule can also be rationalized.
Occurrence of +4 oxidation state
Predicted from [∆atmH + I1 + I2 + I3 + I4] which follows trends in I4.
Ce, Pr Î Ce4+ [4f0], Pr4+ [4f1] - early in series 4f orbitals still comparatively high in energy.
Tb Æ Tb4+ [4f7 valence shell] - half shell effect.
Occurrence of +2 oxidation state
Predicted from [∆atmH + I1 + I2] which follows trends in ∆atmH, which is reverse of trend in I3.
Eu, Sm, Yb Î Eu2+ [4f7], Sm2+ [4f6], Yb2+ [4f14]
- clear influences of electronic shell structure &
from ∆atmH.
General Features of Lanthanide Chemistry
1. similarity in properties, with gradual changes occurring across the lanthanide series: a
size effect from the Lanthanide Contraction
Causes:
Poor screening of nuclear charge by 4f electrons Î steady increase in Zeff.
Relativistic effects influence the shielding characteristics of inner electrons.
2. Primarily the 3+ oxidation state adopted for all elements
Redox chemistry is commonly encountered only for Eu (3+/2+) and Ce (4+/3+).
Some solids formulated as LnII compounds actually contain Ln3+ & delocalized e-.
3. Coordination chemistry is not especially extensive
Chelating ligands are preferred.
4. Bonding on coordination is primarily ionic in character
Complexes undergo rapid ligand exchange.
Why is the bonding so ionic?

4fn electrons are contracted into the core and unable to participate in bonding.
Other implications from lack of covalent bond-forming orbital-availability:
•   No π-backbonding occurs.
•   No simple carbonyl species (except in Ar matrix at 10 K).
•   Cyclopentadienyls are ionic in nature [c.f. Ln(C5H5)3 vs. Fe(C5H5)2].
•   Lanthanide organometallics have different properties from transition metal equivalents.
5. Ln3+ cations display typical a-class (hard) properties
preference for O-donor ligands.
Why not N too? O-donor ligands are more likely to be charged (importance of ionic bonding to
lanthanides!)
6. Binding to water is common
Such that H2O is often found included in products isolated from (aq).
7. Coordination numbers are high
> 6, typically 8, 9,... (up to 12 found).
8. Coordination polyhedra are often ill-defined
Determined by ligand requirements, not by bonding requirements.
No confirmed examples of isomerism.
Solid state structures of binaries are often rather different from those of other metals.
9. Ligand Field Effects are very small
Pale Colours from weak, narrow forbidden f-f optical transitions.
M3+ ions are:
Colourless (La, Ce, Gd, Yb, Lu)
Yellow Pink (Pm, Ho)
Green (Pr, Tm)
Yellow (Sm, Dy)
Lilac (Nd, Er)
Pale Pink (Eu, Tb)
Magnetic properties have spin-orbit coupled contributions (spin-orbit coupling >> ligand field
splittings)
Magnetic & Optical properties are largely independent of environment (e.g. similar spectra in
gas/solution/solid).
Renewed Technological interest in Lanthanides is mainly in optical/magnetic materials .
Solution Chemistry
Solubility
•   Ln3+ are not especially soluble in water.
•   No simple relationship of solubility to cation radius.
•   Depends on small difference between large solvation and lattice energies.
•   Depends on entropy effects.
Hydrated Lanthanide Ions
•   Primary hydration numbers in (aq) are 8, 9.
•   Primary hydration number decreases with Lanthanide Contraction.
•   Secondary hydration number increases with Lanthanide Contraction.
•   Increased  polarization  of  primary  hydration  sphere  by  a  smaller  cation  enhances
hydrogen bonding to water in the secondary hydration sphere.
•   Aqua ions hydrolyze - increasingly so from La to Lu as they become smaller.
Ln(H2O)n3+ + H2O Æ Ln(H2O)n-12+ + H3O+

•   Salts with common anions frequently contain Ln(H2O)93+ with tri-capped trigonal prismatic
geometry.
Coordination Compounds
Strongly complexing, chelating ligands necessary to yield isolable products from (aq).
Some O-donor chelating ligands that form complexes include NO3- , which binds in its chelate
mode.
Notable for high Coordination Numbers.
Ce(NO3)52- - 10-coordinate bicapped dodecahedron.
Ce(NO3)63- - 12-coordinate icosahedron.
Other favoured ligands include: Oxalate, Citrate, Tartrate.
Classic bidentate complexes formed as Ln(L-L)3L' (L' = H2O, py, etc...) or Ln(L-L)4  dehydrate in
vacuo Æ Ln(L-L)3 [ now coordinatively unsaturated ].
Ln(L-L)3 with bulky R are thermally stable, volatile & sublimable, and soluble in non-polar
solvents.
•   Widely used as NMR shift reagents. Polar molecules may coordinate Ln(L-L)3, their NMR
resonances are perturbed by the paramagnetism of Ln, e.g. Eu(facam)3.
•   "Anti-knock" activity as petroleum additives.
Solution Chemistry of Other Lanthanide Oxidation States
Ln(IV)
Cerium is the only Ln4+ with significant aqueous or coordination chemistry.
E° (Ce4+(aq) / Ce3+(aq)) = 1.72 V (others estimated at 2.9 V).
Prepared by the action of a strong oxidizing agent, e.g. S2O82-, on Ce3+(aq).
Widely used as an oxidant itself, e.g. quantitative analysis / organic chemistry.
E° (Ce4+/Ce3+) is markedly dependent on complexation and hydrolysis.
Strong oxidizing agent in perchloric acid solution. In other acids coordination occurs, e.g.
Ce(NO3)62- is generally used for oxidations as its NH4+ salt
Change in pH:
Hydrolysis to Ce(OH)3+ occurs, then polymerization. Ultimately precipitation of yellow gelatinous
CeO2.xH2O.
4+ charge stabilizes halogeno-complexes e.g. CeF84-.
Ln(II)
Significant solution chemistry of Ln2+ is essentially confined to SmII, EuII, YbII
Preparation:
electrolytic reduction of Ln3+(aq).
Eu2+ (the most stable LnII) is prepared by reduction of Ln3+(aq) with Zn/Hg.
Properties:
Ln2+ Aquo-ion colours:
Sm2+ blood-red
Eu2+ colourless
Yb2+ yellow
•   Ln2+(aq) are readily oxidized by air, but Eu2+(aq) is easily handled.
•   Sm2+(aq) & Yb2+(aq) reduce water.
•   Eu2+(aq) is relatively stable in the dark.
•   Carbonate and sulphate salts have been isolated.
•   Sm2+ and Yb2+ salts are susceptible to oxidation by their water of crystallization.

•   Eu & Yb dissolve in liquid ammonia to give intense blue, highly reducing solutions
containing
[Ln(NH3)x]2+  and  solvated  electrons.  Solutions  decompose  on  standing,
precipitating the amide Ln(NH2)2
•   Properties of Ln2+ are closely-related to those of the alkaline earths. In particular Eu2+ is
often likened to Ba2+.
Similar Salt Solubilities (like Ba, sulphates are insoluble, hydroxides are soluble).
Behaviour in  liquid NH3 is very similar.
Similar Coordination Chemistry (Not extensive / Hard ligands)
BUT very different redox chemistry!

Magnetic Properties
o   Paramagnetism.
o   Magnetic properties have spin & orbit contributions (contrast "spin-only" of transition metals).
o   Magnetic moments of Ln3+ ions are generally well-described from the coupling of spin and
orbital angular momenta - Russell-Saunders Coupling Scheme.
o   Spin orbit coupling constants are typically large (ca. 1000 cm-1).
o   Ligand field effects are very small (ca. 100 cm-1).
    only ground J-state is populated.
    spin-orbit coupling >> ligand field splittings.
    magnetism is essentially independent of environment.
o   Magnetic moment of a J-state is expressed by the Landé formula:
Ln3+ Magnetic Moments compared with Theory
Landé formula fits well with observed magnetic moments for all but SmIII and EuIII.
Moments of SmIII and EuIII are altered from the Landé expression by temperature-dependent
population of low-lying excited J-state(s).
Uses of Ln3+ Magnetic Moments?
NMR Shift Reagents - paramagnetism of lanthanide ions is utilized to spread resonances in 1H
NMR of organic molecules that coordinate to lanthanides.
Ferromagnetism / Anti-Ferromagnetism / Ferrimagnetism
Lanthanide metals and alloys have interesting ordered magnetism effects.

SmCo5, Nd2Fe14B permanent magnets - FERROMAGNETIC
    light weight.
    high saturation moments.
    high coercivity.
    high magnetocrystalline anisotropy.
    Superior performance magnets for magnetic bearings / couplings / wavetubes & d.c.
synchronous motors.
Rare Earth Garnets e.g. Ln3Fe5O12 and Y3Fe5O12.
FERRIMAGNETISM shows an unusual temperature-dependence.
As T increases moment falls to zero at the Condensation Temperature.
Above Condensation Temperature moment rises in the opposite direction to a maximum.
Moment, then falls to zero at the Curie Temperature in the normal manner.
Reason?
The magnetic moments of the rare earth and iron ions oppose each other.
The rare earth moments dominate at low temperature.
The rare earth moments randomize at a lower temperature than the iron moments.
Electronic Spectroscopy
Transitions which involve only a redistribution of electrons within the 4f orbitals (f-f transitions) are
orbitally-forbidden by the Selection Rules.
Pale colours of LnIII compounds are usually not very intense.
Crystal/Ligand field effects in lanthanide 4f orbitals are virtually insignificant.
4f electrons are well shielded from external charge by 5s2 & 5p6 shells.
f-f absorption bands are very sharp (useful fingerprinting and quantisation of LnIII).
[ d↔d transitions in transition metal compounds are also orbitally
forbidden, but gain intensity from and are broadened by the
effects of molecular vibrations in distorting the crystal field ].
Optical spectra are virtually independent of environment - similar
spectra in gas/solution/solid (sharp lines like typical gas atom
spectra).
Insensitivity of f-f transitions means of limited use in study of
lanthanide materials.
CeIII and TbIII have high intensity bands in the UV due to 4fn Æ4fn-15d1 transitions, i.e. f-d and
therefore not orbitally forbidden.
Fluorescence / Luminescence
Of certain lanthanides e.g. Tb, Ho & Eu.
Luminescence:
emission of light by material from its absorbing energy.
Photoluminescence:
use of photons for excitation.
Fluorescence:
short time lapse (~ 10-8s) between excitation & emission.
Phosphorescence:
long decay times - luminescence continues long after excitation source is
removed.
Lasers
One of the most common high power lasers is the Neodymium YAG laser.
Host material is Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (YAG), Y3Al5O12, doped with Nd3+.

fluorides only - most oxidising halogen.
CeF4 is comparatively stable e.g. crystallizes as a monohydrate from (aq).
TbF4, PrF4 are thermally unstable and oxidize H2O, i.e. prepare dry.
MF4 all white solids with the UF4/ZrF4 structure.
Dodecahedral coordination of M.
LnX3
All LnX3 are known (except Pm [not attempted] & possibly EuI3).
Typically crystalline / high mp / deliquescent.
Typically obtained as hydrates from (aq).
On heating, react with water to form oxyhalides:
LnX3 + H2O Æ LnOX + 2HX.
At high temperatures react even with glass:
2LnX3 + SiO2 Æ 2LnOX + SiX4.
Preparation of anhydrous LnX3
LnF3:   Ln(NO3)3(aq) + 3HF Æ LnF3•0.5H2O
(very insoluble).
Heat this under an HF atmosphere (for heavy Ln) to obtain anhydrous LnF3.
LnCl3:  Ln2O3 / Ln2(CO3)3 + HCl(aq) Æ LnCl3•6-8H2O (rather soluble).
Heat  this under HCl atmosphere (for heavy Ln) to obtain anhydrous LnCl3.
or
Heat at 300°C, Ln2O3 + 6NH4Cl Æ 2LnCl3 + 3H2O + 6NH3.
LnBr3 / LnI3: Best by direct combination (susceptible to hydrolysis to oxyhalides). Purify by
sublimation (but avoid contact with hot silica!)
Structures:
Ln coordination varies from 9 for light trifluorides to 6 for heavy iodides.
Coordination Environments from LnX3 structures:

∆mH° = 3∆LH(MX2) - 2∆LH(MX3) + 2I3 - ∆atmH°(M) - (I1 + I2)
Irregularities should follow [ 2I3 - ∆atmH°(M) ], i.e. effectively follow I3 [since variation in -∆atmH
follows closely variation in I3.
This explains occurrence of MCl2:
- La, Ce, Pr MCl2 unknown
- (Sm, Eu, Yb)Cl2 are the most stable MCl2  - may be prepared from LnCl3(s) + ½H2
Structures
•   Coordination numbers from 9 to 6
•   Fluorides are Fluorite (CaF2) [C.N. = 8]
•   Nd,Sm,Eu chlorides are PbCl2-type [C.N. = 7 + 2]
•   Nd,Sm,Eu bromides and iodides are SrBr2 type [mixed CN=7 & 8]
•
(Dy,Tm,Yb) I2 have layer structures (CdCl2,CdI2) [CN=6] with polarization effects
Two Classes of dihalide
1. Most LnX2 are regarded as "salt-like" halides (insulators).
2. (Ce,Pr,Gd) I2 have metallic lustre, high conductivity.
Formulation as Ln3+(I-)2(e-) with the electron in a delocalized conduction band.
LnII Compounds are finding increasingly more uses .
Lower Halides
LnX3/Ln melts yield phases of reduced halide formulae e.g. Ln2X3 & LnX.
"Reduced Halides" contain "condensed metal clusters".
Black & metallic increase delocalization of electrons through the metal-metal bonded networks.
Gd2X3 single chains of edge-sharing metal octahedra with M6X8-type environment (i.e. face-
capped by X).
Lowest Halides are stabilized by H, C or N atoms encapsulated in Ln6 cluster octahedra.

Layers of edge-sharing M6C units
e.g. Gd3Cl3C
Framework of M6C units
Hydrides
Preparation: Heat at 300-350°C, Ln + H2 Æ LnH2
Properties of LnH2
Black, reactive, highly conducting, with fluorite structure.
Most thermodynamically stable of all binary metal hydrides.
Formulated as Ln3+(H-)2(e-) with e- delocalized in a metallic conduction band.
Further  H  can  often  be  accommodated  in  interstitial  sites,  and  they  are  frequently
non-
stoichiometric, e.g. LuHx where x = 1.83-2.23 & 2.78-3.00.
With a high pressure of H2 forms LnH3.
Reduced conductivity: salt-like Ln3+(H-)3, except for Eu and Yb (the most stable LnII).
Possible Applications of Rare Earth Intermetallic Hydrides.

Binary Oxides
Ln2O3
The most common lanthanide oxide (notable exceptions; CeO2, Pr6O11, Tb4O7).
Sesquioxides, Ln2O3, are strongly basic, and absorb water / CO from air, forming the hydroxide /
carbonate salts.
They have pale colours, and properties strongly resemble alkaline earth oxides.
Adopt three structure types:

Organometallic Chemistry
Organolanthanide chemistry is not as extensive as organotransition metal chemistry.
Currently receiving a lot of attention, especially in C-H Bond Activation studies.
Primarily ionic in their bonding - contracted nature of the 4f valence orbitals.
Lanthanides cannot act as π-bases hence Ln-CO compounds are not stable.
Organolanthanides are extremely air & moisture sensitive - reflects highly carbanionic character
of organic ligand & oxophilicity of Ln2+/3+.

Comparisons and Contrasts
Yttrium - Why consider it with the Lanthanides?
•   Occurs with lanthanides in rare earth minerals, e.g. monazite.
•   Y occurs effectively exclusively in +3 oxidation state.
•   combines with non-metals Æ YHal3 Y2O3, Y3+(H-)2(e-), YH3, etc...
•   Y3+ has same radius as Ho3+ and is difficult to separate from it.
•   Forms   complexes   of   high   coordination   number   with   chelating   O-donors,   e.g.
Y(acac)3(H2O).
•   Typical organometallics include: Y(C5H5)3 (polymeric in the solid state).
•   Dimeric Y(C5H5)2Cl, monomeric form is a THF adduct
6 Reasons why Scandium could be considered with the Lanthanides
1.   Sc occurs effectively exclusively in +3 oxidation state.
Combines with non-metals Î ScHal3 Sc2O3, etc...
But coordination octahedral (small size).
2.   Sc forms reduced halides.
e.g. Sc7Cl12 which is Sc3+(Sc6Cl12)3- with Sc6 clusters (but c.f. Nb).
3.   Scandium Hydride ScH2 is highly conducting Sc3+(H-)2(e-).
4.   Forms complexes of high coordination number with chelating O-donors, but forms
octahedral complexes with monodentate ligands.
5.   Nitrate & Sulphate are obtained as hydrated salts.
6.   Typical  organometallics  include:  Sc(C5H5)3
(polymeric  in  the  solid  state).  Dimeric
Sc(C5H5)2Cl, monomeric form is a THF adduct.

4 Reasons why Scandium could be considered as main group 3
1.   Sc3+
(r
= 74 pm) is appreciably smaller than any of the rare earths
- behaviour
intermediate between the Lanthanides & Aluminium.
2.   Sc2O3 is more like Al2O3 than Ln2O3: amphoteric in excess OH-.
3.   ScF3 dissolves in excess F- (N.B. scarcity of halogeno complexes for Lanthanides).
4.   Anhydrous ScCl3 is easily obtained by P2O5-dehydration of hydrated halide, but unlike
AlCl3, ScCl3 is not a Friedel-Crafts catalyst.
Scandium may with similarly few exceptions be viewed as a 1st Row Transition Metal
Six-coordinate complexes are typical.
Aqua-ion is Sc(H2O)63+ and is susceptible to hydrolysis Æ O-H-bridged dimers...

THE ACTINIDES
Naturally Occurring Actinides
Only Actinium, Thorium, Protactinium & Uranium occur naturally (i.e. Z ≤ 92).
Actinium & Protactinium occur only in trace amounts.
Neptunium & Plutonium occur in uranium minerals in minute amounts - not appreciated
until after they had been synthesised that the synthesis route might occur naturally!
All isotopes of all the actinides are radioactive.
Most of the longer-lived isotopes decay by α-emission.
Both Thorium and Uranium are far from rare.
Thorium
Widely dispersed, accounts for > 3ppm of the earth's crust.
Natural Thorium is essentially 100% 232Th.
Occurs in monazite [with the rare earths] and in uranothorite [a mixed Th, U silicate].
Obtained as ThO2, thoria, from mineral extraction process.
Used as 99% ThO2 / 1% CeO2 in thoria gas mantles.
Uranium
Widely distributed - found scattered in the faults of old igneous rocks.
Natural Uranium is 99.27% 238U & 0.72% 235U.

Obtained usually as UO2.
Used for nuclear fuel, and on a smaller scale for colouring glass/ceramics.
Basic Features of Nuclear Structure & Chemistry and Radiochemistry
All Radon isotopes are short half-life α-emitters (but give rise to short-lived β-emitters). Radon
gas is derived from Thorium content in granite minerals - hazard in igneous areas.
Actinium and Protactinium occur in uranium ores in trace amounts, because of their participation
in Actinium Decay series (from 235U).
Synthesis of Trans-Uranium Elements - bombardment techniques.
Are there any uses for trans-Uranium elements?
Plutonium:
•
239Pu - produced from 238U by neutron capture in all nuclear reactors.
•
Acts as nuclear fuel in fast-breeder reactors.
•
Processed for nuclear weapon applications.
•
Used as a compact energy source due to the heat from α-decay.
•
N.B. α-emission is harmless, unless the emitter is ingested.
•
Deep-sea diving suits are heated by ca. 750g of 238Pu
•
Combined with PbTe thermoelectric - totally reliable electricity.
•
Used in Apollo space missions.
•
Human heart pacemakers.
Americium:
•
241Am is used as the α-emission source in smoke alarms
Actinide Metals
Preparation
General method for all Actinides:
Reduction of AnF3 or AnF4 with vapours of Li, Mg, Ca or Ba at 1100 - 1400°C
Highly Electropositive.
Typically react with:
•   air Æ tarnishing
•   boiling water or dilute acid Æ releasing Hydrogen
•   most non-metals in direct combination
Structures
Very dense metals (e.g. U = 19 g cm-3) with distinctive structures, e.g. Plutonium has at least 6
allotropes and forms numerous alloys.
General Observations (comparisons with Lanthanides)
¾   Electronic Configurations of Actinides are not always easy to confirm.
Atomic spectra of heavy elements are very difficult to interpret in terms of configuration.
Competition between 5fn7s2 and 5fn-16d7s2 configurations is of interest.
For early actinides promotion 5f Æ 6d occurs to provide more bonding electrons. Much
easier than corresponding 4f Æ 5d promotion in lanthanides.
Second half of actinide series resemble lanthanides more closely.
¾
5f orbitals have greater extension wrt 7s and 7p than do 4f relative to 6s and 6p orbitals, e.g.
ESR evidence for covalent bonding contribution in UF3, but not in NdF3.
¾
5f /
6d / 7s / 7p orbitals are of comparable energies over a range of atomic numbers,
especially U-Am.

Tendency towards variable valency.
Greater tendency towards (covalent) complex formation than for lanthanides, including
complexation with π-bonding ligands.
Electronic  structure  of  an  element  in  a  given  oxidation  state  may  vary  between
compounds and in solution.
Often impossible to say which orbitals are being utilized in bonding.
¾   Ionic Radii of ions show a clear "Actinide Contraction"
Actinide 3+ or 4+ ions with similar radii to their Lanthanide counterparts show similarities
in properties that depend upon ionic radius
Electronic Spectra
Narrow bands (compared to transition metal spectra).
Relatively uninfluenced by ligand field effects.
Intensities are ca. 10 x those of lanthanide bands.
Complex to interpret.
Magnetic Properties
Hard to interpret.
Spin-orbit coupling is large & Russell-Saunders (L.S) Coupling scheme doesn't work.
Ligand field effects are expected where 5f orbitals are involved in bonding.

Principal state for Pa.
Pa5+ chemistry resembles that of Nb5+ / Ta5+ - like a transition metal.
For U, Np, Pu and Am the AnO2+ ion is known (i.e. quite unlike Nb/Ta).
Comparatively few other An(V) species are known.

Actinide Aqueous Chemistry
¾   Latimer & Frost Diagrams for elements in acid & alkaline (aq) indicate actinides are quite
electropositive.
¾   Pa - Pu show significant redox chemistry, e.g. all 4 oxidation states of Pu can co-exist in
appropriate conditions in (aq).
¾   Stability of high oxidation states peaks at U (Np).
¾   An3+ is the maximum oxidation state for (Cf)Es - Lr.
¾   No2+(aq) is especially stable ~ most stable state for No in (aq).
¾   Redox potentials show strong dependence on pH (data for Ac - Cm).
¾   High oxidation states are more stable in basic conditions.
¾   Even at low pH hydrolysis occurs - formation of polymeric ions. When hydrolysis leads to
precipitation measurement of potentials is difficult, e.g. Pa5+ hydrolyses easily; potentials
that indicate it to be the most stable oxidation state are recorded in presence of F- or
C2O42-.
¾   Tendency to disproportionation is particularly dependent on pH, e.g. at high pH 3Pu4+ +
2H2O Ù PuO22+ + 2Pu3+ + 4H+.
¾   Early actinides have a tendency to form complexes - complex formation influences
reduction potentials, e.g. Am4+(aq) only exists when complexed by fluoride
(15 M
NH4F(aq)).
¾   Radiation-induced solvent decomposition produces H• and OH• radicals, which lead to
reduction of higher oxidation states e.g. Pu V/VI, Am IV/VI
Actinide Stereochemistries
Actinide Stereochemistries show similarities with the Lanthanides. High coordination numbers,
e.g.
[Th(NO3)6]2- has distorted icosahedral (C.N. = 12) geometry, and C.N. = 8, 9 are very
common UF82-, Th(S2CNEt2)4

Distortions from idealised stereochemistries
e.g. PuF62- is not octahedral, but widest range of stereochemistries is for An(IV) rather than
An(III), possibly because chemistry of early actinides has received most attention!
Complexes
A wide range of complexes with monodentate and chelating ligands.
Complexing ability:- [M5+] > M4+ > MO22+ > M3+ > MO2+
Geometry may be strongly influenced by covalent bonding effects, e.g. MO22+ unit is always linear
Î UO2(η2-NO3)2(H2O)2 is hexagonal bipyramidal.
Compounds: Actinide Hydrides, Halides, Oxides, Oxyhalides ...
For a given oxidation state show similarly diverse C.N. to Lanthanides.
Different accessible oxidation states - even greater diversity of structure.
Wide variety of oxidation states of ligands & number of oxidation states.

U(III): UCl52-, U2Cl72- and UCl4-.
U(IV): UF73- and UF84- are common, UF62- and UCl62- are also known. Also pseudohalide
complexes, e.g. [U(NCS)8]4-.
U(V): U(V) is usually unstable in (aq),  but UF5 in 48% HF Æ M+UF6- (M+ = Rb+, Cs+, H3O+) salts
U(VI): UF7- and UF82- are known, the latter is more thermally-stable.
Hydrides
Principal Uranium Hydride is UH3 - important as a source material for U(III) and U(IV) chemistry.
Oxides
Many binary phases UOx have been reported.
Many are not genuine phases.
Genuine phases show range of O-content.
The most important genuine phases are UO2, U4O9, U3O8, UO3.
UO2 & U4O9
UO2 (black-brown) has the Fluorite structure. Stoichiometric material is best obtained from:
Interstitial Oxide Ions may be incorporated into the structure - UO
2+x.
Neutron Diffraction studies indicate oxide vacancies in the normal fluorite lattice.
At UO2.25 (U4O9) (black) - interstitials are ordered forming a distinct phase in the phase diagram.

Structure:
> 6 modifications have been characterised.
Most contain O=U=O 'uranyl' groups linked by 4x equatorial bridging O - distorted
octahedral environments.
Uranates
Fusion of uranium oxides with alkali or alkaline earth carbonates - orange/yellow/brown mixed-
oxides, Uranates.
Aqueous Chemistry
Complex aqueous chemistry due to extensive possibilities for complexation, hydrolytic reactions,
often leading to polymeric ion species.
Reduction Potentials appropriate for 1M HClO4 indicate:
U3+
Powerful reducing agent, reduces H2O to H2 (solutions in 1M HCl stable for days).
Obtained by reduction of UO22+ electrolytically or with Zn/Hg.
U4+
Only slightly hydrolysed in 1M acid solution U4+ + H2O ÙU(OH)3+ + H+.
But, it can give rise to polymeric species in less acid solutions.
Regarded as a 'stable' oxidation state of uranium in (aq).
UO2+
Extremely unstable to disproportionation.
Evidence for its existence in (aq) from stopped-flow techniques.
More stable in DMSO (half-life ~ 30 mins).
UO22+
The Uranyl ion.
Very stable, and forms many complexes.
A dominant feature of uranium chemistry.
Reduced to U4+ by e.g. Zinc, Cr2+
Re-oxidation by H218O2 Æ U18O22+
Re-oxidation by 18O2 Æ U(18O16O)2+
Linear, symmetrical (O=U=O)2+ structure.
Why is it trans linear, whereas WO22+ is cis, bent?
WO22+ (6d0) is cis bent because it allows π-donation from the 2 O to 2 independent d-orbitals, with
a single d-orbital shared.
ThO2 (6d05f0) is bent (122o) for similar reasons i.e. no f-orbital participation.
UO22+ (6d05f0) is trans, linear because of the participation of its 5f orbitals.
U(5f) are of considerably lower energy than Th(5f).

Nuclear Reactors, Atomic Energy & Uranium Chemistry
Principles of Nuclear Reactors
¾   Nuclear fission = large nucleus splitting into 2 highly energetic smaller nuclei + neutrons.
¾   Sufficient neutrons of suitable energy can induce fission of further nuclei Æ Chain
reaction.
¾   To sustain chain reaction a critical mass of uranium must be achieved (prevents neutron
loss).
¾   Kinetic energy of main fragments is converted to heat (106x energy of same mass of
coal).
¾   Only naturally-occurring fissile nucleus is 235U (0.72% natural abundance).
Modern Nuclear Reactors
¾   Current nuclear reactors use UO2 fuel - less reactive than U metal.
¾   Enrichment is by fractional gaseous centrifugation of UF6 (easily sublimed).
¾   Neutron capture by 238U results in formation of 239Pu, which is fissile. Significant amounts
of  Pu  will  only  be  produced  in  an  unmoderated  reactor
(fuel  reprocessing  more
dangerous!)
Coolants
¾   Water/Heavy Water - to keep it liquid it must be pressurized.
¾   CO2 gas - in the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor.
