GENERAL ORGANOMETALLICS NOTES
The 18 Electron Rule
The 18 electron rule comes about in a similar way to the octet rule encountered for p
block compounds, where a model of filling all bonding orbitals gives a stable compound.
It states that “Stable organometallic complexes are formed when the sum of the neutral
metal valence electrons plus the sum of the electrons considered to be donated by the
ligand (and taking into account any net charge) equals eighteen”.
Thus, for octahedral and tetrahedral complexes, this would mean filling of the following
MO:
Exceptions -
Only applies to TMs. It is typically obeyed by complexes with dn>2 and strong π-acceptor
ligands.
A class system was introduced to highlight deviations:
Class I:
12 - 22 valence electrons. Comes about when eg are only weakly antibonding and t2g
are not receiving / donating electrons. Thus it applies for 1st row Transition Metals (eg low
in Energy) and weak field ligands (t2g not used).
Class II:
These Notes are copyright Alex Moss 2003. They may be reproduced without need for permission.
 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




- 2 -
Up to 18 valence electrons. eg now too high in energy to be used, so common for 2nd/3rd
row TM’s and strong field ligands (good σ-donors).
Class III:
Obey 18 electron rule. t2g are π-bonding (occupied) with eg strongly antibonding. This is
the vast majority for Organometallic TM’s.
Another major exception is Square Planar Complexes, where a 16 electron rule applies
instead. This is because now the splitting appears as:
Other exceptions are usually due to steric factors, particularly in the early TM’s (low
valence electron counts). For example,
(Cp)2TiCl2 will not add another ligand and
remains as 16 electrons, due to too much crowding with the bulky Cp Ligands.
Coordinative Unsaturation:
Complexes with less than an 18e count are said to be this, and there may be a tendency
to add further ligands. This is because there must be one or more vacant orbitals able to
accept electrons.
Counting Electrons
Formal Oxidation State:
OS = Charge on complex - Sum of charges formally assigned to the ligands on removal
from metal centre.
dn electron count:
dn give you the number of electrons associated with the metal.
dn = metal group number - formal OS.
Formal charges and electron counts are assigned to typical ligands as follows:

2)  Bridging (less common). 3c2e often.
3)  Agostic alkyls.

Alkyls
•   M-C bond strength increases with increasing p hybridisation:
M-CR3 < M=CR2 < M-C≡CR
•   M-C bond strength increases down a TM Group (see Transition Metals in
general).
•   M-C bond strength increases across a Series.
•   M-C bond strength typically similar to main group metals. However, TM alkyls
kinetically much less stable. TM alkyls have low energy d orbitals, which leads to
low energy decomposition routes. Compounds such as TiMe4 dimerise (the dimer
decomposes easily), while PbMe4 requires bond homolysis to decompose.
•   Kinetic stabilisation can be affected by block vacant coordination sites, or using
bulky alkyl groups without β-hydrogens. Also, 18 electron complexes prevent β-H
elimination as well.
Carbonyls
Carbonyl ligands bind by σ-donation (poor) and also π-back-bonding (significant).
These Notes are copyright Alex Moss 2003. They may be reproduced without need for permission.
 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




- 5 -
Factors that affect back-bonding:
How much the metal can donate its electrons (i.e. its d count). If it has more d electrons
to donate, then the backbonding will be stronger.
•   Charge on the metal. A more positive metal is less likely to donate its electrons.
Thus backbonding has a greater stabilising influence on low oxidation state
metals, as they are able to back-bond more effectively (will relinquish their
electrons more easily).
•   Other Ligand present. An electron-withdrawing ligand such as Cp will reduce the
degree of back-bonding. Conversely ligands such as alkyls reduce the degree of
electron withdrawal.
•   Coordination Modes. The CO ligand can be terminal, doubly bridging or even
triply bridging. This bridging tends to reduce CO bond strength due to greater
population of π* CO.
The consequence of more back-bonding is a stronger M-C and a weaker C=O bond.
Thus, the strength can be indirectly measured by infra-red spectroscopy, where a lower
stretching frequency indicates more back-bonding occurring (weaker C=O).
Carbenes
Of the form LnM=CR2.
MLn must have 2 d electrons to donate for the π component of the bond.
Fischer - metal d π-donor orbitals are lower energy than the CR2 fragment’s p-orbital.
This is usually the case for metals stabilised by CO ligands.
Schrock (alkylidene) - metal orbitals are higher energy than CR2 fragment’s p-orbitals.
Difference affects polarity of the M=C bond. Fischer => carbene is electrophilic (LUMO
has carbon character) while for Schrock => carbene is nucleophilic (HOMO has carbon
character).

Metal-Alkene Complexes
The  alkene  HOMO
(carbon-carbon  π-bonding)  and  LUMO
(carbon-carbon  π*-
antibonding) are the important ligand orbitals involved.
Principal bonding features described by the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model:
A = electrons from the alkene HOMO are formally donated into empty transition metal d-
type hybrid orbital.
B = electrons from a filled metal d function are transferred by π-back-bonding to the
vacant alkene LUMO.
This is synergic bonding (as for carbonyls).
Extreme case - metal to alkene π* orbital back-bonding is very extensive, the alkene
may be considered to be a dianionic “di-alkyl” type ligand (D). This occurs for very e-
deficient alkenes and/or very e-rich metals.
Otherwise, alkenes are usually considered to be neutral ligands (C).

Sandwich Compounds
M-C bond length is expected to decrease across the series (as radius of M decreases
with Zeff increasing). Increase in r(M-C) (i.e. weakening of the bond - against the trend)
occurs when population of the π* orbitals occurs.
Bent Sandwiches

The consequence of this is that all bonding interactions are in the equatorial plane.
Mechanisms and Reaction Types
Association and Dissociation:
[M] + L Æ [M]-L
Typically results in the valence electron count increasing by 2, but Oxidation State and
d-count remain the same.
Substitution:
[M]-L + L’ Æ [M]-L’ + L
Net no change in valence electrons, d-count or Oxidation State. Typically proceeds via
first Dissociation, since a 20e intermediate would be highly unstable (occupation of σ*
orbitals required).
Oxidation and Reduction:
Gain or loss of electrons. For oxidation, leads to change in valence electron count (-1),
oxidation state (+1) and d-count (-1).
Migratory Insertion
[M]-A + B Æ [M]-B-A
No net change in electron counts or oxidation states. Classic Example: Me insertion into
Mn carbonyl compound. Proceeds via migration of ligand, then insertion of B.
Formal Definition:
Insertion of an unsaturated ligand (Y) into an adjacent M-X bond.

Contrast with:

Two Main Types:
(A) 1,1 Insertion
e.g. X = Me, AB = CO
(B) 1,2 Insertion
e.g. X = H, AB = H2C=CH2
General Features of Insertion Reactions
1.  No change in formal oxidation state of metal centre, except if inserting ligand (Y)
is M=C or MC.
2.  Groups must be adjacent (cis) to each other.
3.  Vacant coordination site is created during the forward reaction.
4.  When the X ligand is chiral, the reaction generally proceeds with retention of
configuration.
5.  Examples of X-migration and Y-insertion are known.
6.  Position of equilibrium depends upon the strength of M-X, M-Y, and M-(XY)
bonds.
7.
1-electron oxidation often speeds up reaction.

•   Only migration can give correct product distribution.
•   Cannot get trans isomer by de-insertion of CO.
Rate Law for Carbonylation Reaction
Under Normal conditions the following rates are observed
k1 is rate determining, i.e. 1st Order in alkyl-Mn
0th Order in L (incoming ligand)
if k2 is >>> k-2, then,
High [L]: First order in starting material
Low [L]: Mixed order kinetics
Rate constants are found to be identical for the substitution of CO in Me-CO-Mn(CO)5
and for the decarbonylation of the acetyl compound, i.e. they have the same rate
determining step.
Rate accelerated by Lewis Acid catalysis, e.g. H+, AlCl

Note: Reaction is retarded by extra phosphine.
Mechanisms of Oxidative Addition Reactions
• No single mechanism holds for all oxidative-addition reactions.
• 3 main mechanism have been observed depending on the reactants, and conditions.
Types:
(a) Concerted.
(b)
(i) Nucleophillic Attack (SN2).
(ii) Ionic Mechanism.
(c) Radical Reaction.
Concerted Mechanism
Characteristics:
• Involves a 3-centre Transition State, with side on approach of the incoming molecule.
• Molecule X—Y attaches to the reaction centre and simultaneously or subsequently
undergoes electron rearrangement from X—Y bond to M—X and M—Y bonds.
i.e.
• In Transition State there synergetic electron-flow
X—Y(σ)
M(σ)
M(π)
X—Y(σ*)
Features of Concerted Mechanism
• Coordinatively unsaturated molecule
• Common when X—Y group has low bond polarity, e.g. H2, R3Si—H
• Stereospecific and cis-addition
e.g.
Cis-addition shown by Infrared Spectroscopy.
Observe 2 M—H stretching bands (symmetric and asymmetric)
Note: Only one asymmetric if Trans.
• If X—Y is chiral then reaction proceeds with retention
e.g.

- 15 -
• Side on addition of H2 has low activation energy.
Considering the strength of H—H bond
(420 kJ mol-1) suggests "early T.S." with
little H—H stretching.
Thus Kinetic isotope effect small:
• Rates for Vaska's complex + H
2
X = I > Br > Cl (Ratios of Rate = 100:4:0.9).
Electron density on the metal centre is crucial in determining ∆G.
Donation into H2(σ*) appears to be the most important factor.
Note: If replace CO by CS (better π-Acceptor) get no reaction with H2.
Nucleophilic Attack
• Favoured when X—Y bond is polar, e.g. RX, HX, HgCl2.
• Dipolar Transition State expected.
Metal centre acts as electron pair donor (nucleophile).
For reactions involving R—X, inversion of stereochemistry at the α-carbon, analogous to
SN2 reactions, e.g.
Features of nucleophilic Attack
•   Trans addition.
•   Rates faster in polar solvents.
•   Large -ve ∆S‡ , due to solvent organisation around the dipolar Transition State.
•   Rates sensitive to nature of other ligands (L) - more electron donating the
ligands, faster the rate of addition.
•   Hammett plots indicate increased ligand basicity leads to increased
nucleophilicity of M-centre.
•   Steric effects, increasing size of ligands decreases the rate of oxidative addition;
due to crowding of Transition State.
Ionic Mechanism
•   In polar solvents (eg. MeOH) sometimes addition less stereospecific.
•   In polar solvents the lifetime of the +ve charged 5-coordinate intermediate drawn
for the nucleophilic mechanism is enhanced.

Radical Reactions
1 Alkyl (not methyl), vinyl, aryl halides react with Vaska's complex by radical chain
reaction.
RATE depends on:
(1) initiators
(2) inhibitors
(3) radical spin traps
Typical initiators include O2, Ir(II) or hν
Features of chain mechanism
Complete loss of stereochemistry of R in R—X
2 17-electron ML5 complexes such as Co(II)-d7 undergo stepwise free radical addition.
Features of stepwise reaction:
• 2nd order kinetics
• Reactants extracts a radical fragment from X—Y
• Racemisation at C-based radicals

•   May imply a different mechanism operating in each case.
•   Ta case one alkyl may be deprotonated at α-carbon by another alkyl group.

•   Reverse of oxidative addition.
•   Leads to the formation of new bond between A and B groups
•   Examples using a wide variety of A and B ligands are known
•   Concerted reaction
Examples:
To Enhance and/or allow intramolecular Reductive Elimination
•   Require cis disposition of A and B ligands around metal centre
•   High formal charge on Metal (M)
•   If the Metal centre is too electron-rich, reductive elimination will be inhibited.
•   Rates of reductive Elimination
C-H > H-H > C-C
•   Stereochemistry at Cα retained.

Thermolysis of neutral complex gives ethylene and ethane - result of initial β-Hydrogen
elimination.
Electrochemical oxidation to the monocation gives ethylene, ethane, and butane - as a
result of homolysis of Fe-Et bond, giving Et. radicals.
Further oxidation to the dication gives butane rapidly by reductive elimination.
If the Metal centre is too electron-rich, reductive elimination will be inhibited.
The reaction is inhibited by addition of PMe3, implying a pre-equilibrium involving loss of
PMe3.
3 x PMe3 make the metal centre too electron rich for elimination.
Labelling experiments show:
•   Intramolecular reaction
•   No crossover
Concerted
& cis - no
scrambling
Rate is 107 from the coordinatively unsaturated complex above.
Rates of Reductive Elimination
Thermodynamic driving force ∆G‡ usually increases in the order
H-H < C-H < C-C
RATE: C-H > H-H > C-C
The need for reorientation of a highly directional methyl sp3 hybrid orbital leads to a
substantial kinetic barrier for CH3-CH3 coupling.
Inverse isotope effects (kH/kD) less than 1.0 have been observed for both C-H, and H-H
elimination.
The equilibrium lies further to the right for D vs H.
Therefore kD > kH

Dihydrogen-Dihydride Exchange:
Nucleophilic Attack on Ligand
[M]-A + B Æ [M]-A-B
An example would be attack on Cp (complex net charged) by MeLi, or attack on an
alkene (complex net charged) by H-.
Syntheses
Alkyls -
a)  Transmetallation. Use Mg / Li reagents.
b)  Carbonylate anions, [LnM(CO)x]n- act as nucleophiles to attack e.g. MeI.
c)  Form metal hydrides (then use these to attack alkenes and β-eliminate).
d)  Oxidative Addition - using e.g. MeI and 16e compound.
Carbonyls -
a)  metal + CO - needs low enthalpy of atomisation. Works only for Ni and Fe.
b)  Metal halide/salt + reducing agent + CO, e.g. CrCl3 + Al + 6CO gives Cr(CO)6 +
AlCl3.
Sandwich -
Arenes:
a)  Fischer-Hafner. Ring + MCl3 + Al + NO2S2O4. Works for 1st row TMs only.
b)  Metal atom / vapour. M(s) + electron gun, then add rings to M (atoms). Works for
M = Ti, Nb, W, Mo + some lanthanides. Helps if R substituents on ring.
Cyclopentadienes:
Easier to make since Cp(-) has degree of ionic interaction. Use salt-elimination routes
from NaCp / LiCp* + metal halide.
