Fourier Transform Techniques
Simplest way of recording a spectrum is to use a tunable monochromatic source. However, few of
these can be tuned over a wide range of frequencies are available, so spectra are commonly
recorded using a broad-band source, whose output contains all frequencies of interest.
The problem then becomes how to separate out the information about intensities at each
frequency from the overall transmission. The usual method (at least in the range UV to IR) is to
use a diffraction grating
(or similar device) to spatially separate the radiation at different
frequencies.
There is another way of separating the information according to frequency, and this involves the
interference phenomena that are also responsible for the dispersive effect of a diffraction grating.
If interference effects can be made to alter the amplitude of the total radiation reaching the
detector as a function of time, a Fourier transform will convert the record of amplitude A(t) into the
desired spectrum I(v). This is carried out using a computer, which can also perform other
functions such as controlling operation of the instrument and storage of spectra.
Fourier Transform (FT) techniques are now of great importance in two areas: NMR and IR. In
NMR, interference is generated during the relaxation of nuclear spins, which gives beats of
frequency which can be Fourier Transformed to generate a spectrum. In IR, the interference is
generated by recombination of beams that have travelled different distances, and the path
difference is Fourier Transformed this time.
Note that diffraction methods depend on interference effects as well, but for crystal data a 3D
Fourier  Transform is required to generate a three-dimensional map of the positions in the crystal.
It is useful in fluid samples though.
The FT method enables spectra to be recorded much more rapidly than by direct observation of
absorption. It may also offer major advantages of both sensitivity and resolution.

Essential Features:
The technique of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy can be applied only to
species having one or more unpaired electrons, e.g. free radicals and many transition metal
compounds. Observation of an EPR spectrum proves that at least part of the sample has

unpaired  electrons,  and  the  technique  is  particularly  valuable  for  the  study  of  unstable
paramagnetic species which may be generated in situ, e.g. by electrochemical oxidation or
reduction, or by irradiation.
EPR spectroscopy complements bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements as a means of
studying  paramagnetic  compounds,  but  is  usually  concerned  with  short-range  atomic  or
molecular properties, as opposed to the bulk properties of a paramagnetic ensemble.
The spin of an electron and its associated magnetic moment (possibly with some contribution
from orbital angular momentum) are the basis of EPR Spectroscopy. The basis theory follows
closely that of NMR Spectroscopy.
For radicals the g-factor is normally close to the free-electron value (2), but for transition metal
compounds spin-orbit coupling and other factors can lead to major variations.
Transitions between such energy levels can be induced by the application of radiation with the
appropriate frequency:
hv = gµBB0
The frequency required depends on B0 (usually fields of 0.34T and 1.24T).
Hyperfine Interactions - the simple picture must be modified if the electron can interact with a
neighbouring magnetic nucleus having a spin quantum number MI. The energy levels become:
E = g µBMSB0 + aMsMI
Where the constant is called the hyperfine coupling constant.
Relaxation can occur by various mechanism, via:
Spin-lattice, Spin-Spin and Chemical Exchange
Relaxation is typically efficient and fast (compared with NMR). Hence EPR signals are broad and
are most easily recorded in practice their first-derivatives.
Photoelectron Spectroscopy
There are two distinct classes of experiment, using different sources.
XPES
Uses an X-ray source, e.g. Al Kα1.2 lines. Effective resolution of only ~1eV, so typically poor for
gaseous species (the linewidth is limited by the lifetime of the hole left by the transition, which is
short). The mean free path in a solid is typically about 10Å, so only electrons ionised from atoms
near the surface reach the kinetic energy analyser without losing energy. These give sharp
ionisation peaks. Hence, it is a surface-sensitive technique. Core ionisations from np and nd
shells can have very pronounced spin-orbit splitting, when n is large.
XPES has two main applications:
a)   ESCA (Electron-Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis).
This examines the binding energies of core electrons, determined by effective nuclear
charge. Responds to chemical environment through the charge distribution in the valence
shell. Often a simple correlation can be made with the charge on the atom, which in turn
depends on the oxidation state and the degree of covalency in bonding. This gives useful
chemical information when structural data is not available, i.e. when the material is glassy or
disordered, or when the surface of the solid does not have the same structure as the bulk
solid.
b)   Valence Shell Structure in solids.
The spectra give good representation of the energy distribution of filled states in the valence
band, and can distinguish metallic compounds from insulators. Kinetic energies are always
measured relative to the Fermi Level of the metallic components in the spectrometer. It is
noticed that ionisation of the d-electrons are much more probably than the p-electrons - a

common feature of XPES. Ionisation probabilities depend on the radial distribution of the
ionised electrons, and vary from shell to shell. The intensity of d-shell ionisations is obviously
helpful in the study of the electronic structure of transition metal compounds.
UVPES
This uses hard UV photons from an electric discharge in helium gas. He(II) is commonly used as
a source (brighter). Source linewidths are small and the resolution of the spectrum is usually
limited by the quality of the electron kinetic energy analyser, typically ~10meV. Although the
surfaces of solids can be studied, the resolution is most usefully and frequently employed in the
gas phase. It is common to resolve vibrational features. Samples must have a reasonable vapour
pressure. Species that can be easily studied are limited to smallish covalent molecules, and
UVPES  has  been  widely  applied  to  elucidate  the  electronic  structure  of  organometallic
compounds. The spectrometer needs to be differentially pumped, to allow high vacuum in the
electron analyser portion of the instrument.
Koopmans Theorem states that Ij = -εj. This approximation relates the ionisation energy from the
jth orbital to the energy of an electron in that orbital calculated by self-consistent field methods. It
is usually fairly accurate, as the neglect of the electron reorganisation energy following ionisation,
which would lower the energy of the ionisation, is nearly offset by the increase in electron-
electron repulsion energy due to the contraction of the orbitals in the ion.
Photoionisation Probability or Cross-Sections vary quite strongly with the energy of the outgoing
photoelectrons, and in general decrease. For our purposes it is only necessary to know that d-
shell and f-shell ionisations become considerably more intense relative to p-shell ionisations from
the ligands in He(II) relative to He(I) spectra. This feature is used to assign the ionisations to
these orbitals, or determine the proportion of metal character in a molecular orbital.
Bonding Character. The PES spectrum not only maps out orbital energies, but the vibrational
structure (or its absence) is a good indicator of final state distortions, that are driven by the
removal of the electron. Thus it can distinguish the degree of bonding or non-bonding character of
the ionised electron. A particularly strong distortion can occur if the final state is Jahn-Teller
unstable, and in this case the ionisation peak may split into two distinct components.
Spin-Orbit Coupling. If the ion contains a hole in a shell with orbital angular moment (i.e. not s),
spin-orbit components may be resolvable. Since the splitting is very dependent on the atomic
number it can be used to measure heavy atom contributions to the MO’s, and thus to assign the
features in the spectrum to particular orbitals.
Matrix Isolation
Matrix isolation involves the preparation of a rigid solid sample in which the molecular species of
interest are at once isolated and effectively immobilised in an inert host lattice or matrix. The
species are thus preserved, typically at high dilution and low temperatures (4-50K) and are
thereby denied the opportunity for bimolecular collisions and the thermal energy for unimolecular
decomposition. They key features are:
•   Rigid Host (to immobilise the guest species).
•   Inert Host (e.g. solid Ar, to minimise perturbation of the guest).
•   High Dilution (for effective isolation).
•   Low Temperatures (to minimise the thermal energy available to the molecule).
Lifetime - can extend lifespan of reactive molecules almost indefinitely.
Detection and Characterisation - various spectroscopic methods can be used to study the matrix.
The most important methods in practice are those of Electronic, EPR, and particularly Infrared.

Reaction Intermediates
- matrix isolation provides an alternative to flash photolysis, pulse
radiolysis, and other time-resolved spectroscopic methods of studying reaction intermediates.
Apparatus - reaction carried out in situ, so that reactive intermediate can be effectively trapped.
Characterisation of an Unknown Molecule by IR Spectroscopy -
•   By systematic variations of the conditions we aim to discover how many distinct species
are present in the matrix.
•   For each species we determine the number, relative intensities, and frequencies of the IR
absorptions.
•   We draw on the evidence of distinctive features, e.g. v(CO), and analogies with known
molecules to deduce the likely nature of the unknown.
•   Use of the vibrational selection rules may give vital clues to molecular symmetry.
•   Isotopic Effects are likely to be vital for conclusive evidence of stoichiometry, geometry,
and  dimensions  of  the  trapped  molecule.  Hence  it  may  be  possible  via  normal
coordination analysis to determine force constants for the molecule.
•   Theoretical calculations can now be carried out at a sufficiently high level to forecast the
frequency and intensity patterns making up the IR spectrum of the molecule.
•   Confirmation of identity may also be found by seeking independent routes to the
compound.
•   Sample-warming may also be helpful in identifying reactive molecules when diffusion
provides the opportunity for simple bimolecular reactions to occur.
Optical Properties of Solids
For Solids:
•   No rotations.
•   Fixed orientation relative to polarised light.
•   Fixed relative to oriented external perturbations - Magnetic Fields (Zeeman, Circular
Dichroism), Electric Fields (Stark), Pressure.
•   Low Temperatures (~1.5K) possible - no thermal vibrational energy, simplified spectrum,
sharp transitions (long relaxation times).
•   Well defined crystalline environment - well defined excitation energies.
Hence, spectra are sharp and have lots of information contained in them.
