PRE-TRANSITION METAL NOTES
The Ionic Model
Groups 1 & 2, plus the Lanthanides (f-contraction Î little covalency). Provides simple
equations  for  calculation  of  interaction  energies  between  ions
(∆HL)  and  dipolar
molecules (e.g. ∆Hhyd).
Evidence for the existence of ions:
Electrical conductivity when molten or dissolved in polar solvents.
Electronic Spectra (charge transfer) - similarity between spectra of gas phase/solutions
and solid compounds.
Magnetic - unpaired electrons. Similarity between gas/solid again.
Electron-density measurements - x-ray diffraction data along the internuclear axis.
Lattice Enthalpy
∆HL of a compound MX is  the enthalpy change when:
MX(s) Î M+(g) + X-(g)
Can be found by using Born-Haber Cycles (Enthalpy is a state function).
For NaCl:
∆Ho / kJ mol-1

Æ     Cl-(g)

Summing all the reactions above, we have:
NaCl(s)
Æ     Na+(g) + Cl-(g)
774 (∆HLo)
Notes:
-
the reverse of equation (2) is the definition of the standard enthalpy of formation
of solid NaCl.
-
Equations (3) and (4) together define the standard enthalpy of formation of
Na+(g).
-
Equations (5) and (6) together define the standard enthalpy of formation of Cl-(g).
Notice that the enthalpy change (5) is half the bond enthalpy of the chlorine
molecule.
Thus,
∆HL [NaCl(s)] = ∆Hf [Na+(g)] + ∆Hf [Cl-(g)] - ∆Hf [NaCl(s)]
∆Hf [NaCl(s)] = ∆Hf [Na+(g)] + ∆Hf [Cl-(g)] - ∆HL [NaCl(s)]

So for NaCl, each Na has 6 Cl ions as nearest neighbours distance r away, then 12 Na
ions as next nearest neighbours distance r
2 away, and so on.

The series in brackets converges to a constant, the Madelung Constant, A. It is entirely

When considering the short-range repulsive interactions, it can also be suggested that E
= B/rn, where B is a constant and n is the Born-Exponent.
Then by differentiation we obtain the Born-Lande Equation for the total Energy:

These equations imply that ionic attractions are a long range force (1/r), compared to
covalent (nearest neighbour) and van der Waals (1/r6).
They depend only on the radius of the ions, which implies that same radius = same
behaviour. Properties independent of nature of ions.
The degree of packing in the structures depends on the Madelung Constant (not
Radius/Ratio Rules! - unreliable).
The Kapustinskii Equation
Ratio of Madelung Constant to total number of ions per formula unit (ν) for a series of
compounds are very similar. Thus, the variation of A/νr between structures is very small.
The following approximations are made:
a)  replace A with 0.87ν.
b)  internuclear distance taken as sum of ionic radii.
c)  Value of n=9 for NaCl can be taken as average for all structures.

Estimating Ionic Radii -
Lande:
Suggested that in LiI, with a small cation and a large anion, the large I- are in contact
and hence from the unit cell parameter an ionic radius of I- can be derived. By examining
other metal halides a table of ionic radii could be drawn up.

Pauling:
Theoretical basis: in many-electron atoms and ions, screening and penetration effects
result in the electrons experiencing an effective nuclear charge, Zeff = Z - σ, where σ is
the screen constant calculated using Slater’s Rules. Pauling therefore propose that:
Rionic = Cn/Zeff = Cn/(Z-σ), where Cn is a constant depending on the principal quantum
number n. For isoelectronic ions such as Na+/F-, K+/Cl-, Mg2+/O2-, the Cn values for the
pairs should be the same. Thus,
r(Na+)/r(F-) = [ Z(F-) - σ ] / [ Z(Na+) - σ ].
Knowing r(Na+) + r(F-) from crystallographic data, the ionic radii can be calculated.
Shannon and Prewitt:
Compiled unit cell data for more than 1000 compounds and evaluated a set of self-
consistent ionic radii which can best reproduce the experimentally observed internuclear
distances. They based their data set on r(O2-) = 140pm and r(F-) = 133pm. The values
they obtained were in good agreement with those from other methods. The Shannon-
Prewitt ionic radii are the most commonly used data set.
Thermochemical Radii:
Ionic radii for complex ions such as NO3-, CO32-, SO42-, NH4+. Use a Born-Haber cycle to
calculate  the  lattice  enthalpy,  then  the  Kapustinskii  equation  to  calculate
(ra++rb-),
knowing ra+ one can calculate rb-.
Trends in Ionic Radii
1.  For isoelectronic pairs, the cation is smaller than the anion.
2.  Across a row, radii of isoelectronic cations decrease rapidly, but the change in
anionic  radii  is  less  pronounced.  Electrons  added  to  the  same  shell
(Zeff
increases).
3.  Down a group the radii increase. Electrons are added to extra shells, and
penetration (increase Zeff) not as dominant as increasing n.
4.  Ionic radii depend on coordination number. Increase slightly with CN. This is due
to increased anion repulsion around the cation.
5.  d/f contractions. Thus Group 11 & 12 ions are smaller than Group 1 and 2. 3d/4f
orbitals are non-penetrating and so poor shielders, which causes Zeff to rise.
“Diagonal Relationship” - r (Li+) ≈r (Mg2+), and similarly r(Na+) ≈ r(Ca2+). This is due to
points 2 and 3, and often leads to similar chemistry (e.g. isostructural compounds).
Covalency
This effect causes lattice enthalpy and solvation energy to increase (not expected from
the Ionic Model).
Covalence should be considered for polarisable anions (large, low electronegativity) and
polarising cations (Z2/r, i.e. small or highly charged, e.g. Be2+, Zn2+).

- 5 -
∆Hd = -610 kJ mol-1. Unstable wrt disproportionation. Common in Group 2 for M+.
Stability of compounds with small anions (F-, H-) decrease down the groups, while
stability increases for large anions. Exception is Mg.
Stability of halides decreases down the halide group, but the decrease is less severe for
large cations.
Only Li of Group 1 forms stable nitride. All Group 2 form nitrides.
Structural Chemistry
(SEE TUTORIAL 1 FOR MORE DETAIL)
All hydrides, halides and hydroxides of Group 1 have Rock Salt structure except CsCl,
CsBr, CsI. All oxides have anti-fluorite structure except Cs2O. Superoxides (MO2) have
pyrite structure.
Group 2 Oxides except BeO have Rock Salt structure. Most of the fluorides are fluorite
structures, except BeF2 / BeF4 which are tetrahedral chains, and MgF2 which is rutile.
Other halides are difficult to predict and tend to adopt distorted/layered structures due to
polarisability. CN > 8 for some Barium compounds.
As cations increase in size, the thermal stability of compounds with large complex ions
increases. For example, heating Li in air gives the oxide, Na on the other hand forms
peroxide, while the other Group 1 elements for superoxide. Rb and Cs also form a series
of sub-oxides with unusual structures based on OM6 octahedra.
Heating the nitrates of Group 1 gives nitrites, except Li which forms the oxide. Stability of
carbonates, sulphates, etc. increase down the group.
The ionic model can also predict the course of reactions using lattice enthalpies. For
example,
LiI + NaF Î LiF + NaI
2NaF + CaCl2 Æ 2NaCl + CaF2
These occur because the lattice enthalpy of LiF and CaF2 is very high (the latter despite
r(Na+) ≈ r(Ca2+)).
But there are notable exceptions, especially those involving complex ion salts:
NaNO3 + KCl Æ NaCl + KNO3
NaNO3 + LiCl Æ NaCl + LiNO3
Both reactions found to be thermodynamically favourable even though r(Cl-) < r(NO3-).
Here we expect the combination of the smaller Na+ and Cl- to provide the lattice enthalpy
driving force for the first reaction, but on these grounds the second reaction should not
proceed. Apparently, there is stronger than expected interaction between the small Li+
and the non-spherical nitrate ion.
Also the following reactions:
AgF + KCl Æ AgCl + KF
HgF2 + 2KCl Æ HgCl2 + 2KF

In these two reactions, the substantial non-ionic contributions to the lattice enthalpies of
AgCl and HgCl2 provide the driving force.

Thus, have to look at which factors change by the greatest amounts to determine
stability.
∆HL can be controlled. If r- is small, then the proportional decrease in ∆HL is large (by
differentiation). If r- is large, the ∆HL decreases slowly.
Nitrides:
For Group 1, only Li is sufficiently small to form Li3N. All other M3N compounds are
endothermic. This is because ∆HL is large with the small Li+ ion, whereas Na+ is too
large.
For Group 2, z+ = +2, and ν = 5, gives a very large ∆HL. All form M3N2.
Both Group 1 and Group 2 trends can be justified by the Kapustinskii Equation.
Hydrides:
Much less stable than F/O compounds. Not due to polarisability of H- though. The ∆Hf of
H- is +140 kJ mol-1, compared to -271 kJ mol-1 for F-. H-H bond is very strong, while the
F-F is weak (due to lone pair repulsions).
Halides:
For halides in general, the stability increases down the group as it gets easier to form the
metal ions due to the valence electron being in a higher energy orbital. This term
dominates.
However, with fluorides, the small radii means that the lattice enthalpy term is quite large
and is responsive to changes in cation size, and so with increasing cation size, the
lattice enthalpy is very small and so they are less favourable down the group.
Oxides:
For group 2 the stability of the oxides decreases as the lattice enthalpy term is getting
much smaller.
For group 1, the situation is complex as there are many types of oxides besides O2- that
can form, and so the stability isn't simply with respect to the elements. With respect to
the elements the stability decreases down the group. It should be noted however, that
compounds such as Na2O2 and NaO2 are formed as well as Na2O.

Oxy acid salts:
In general, stability with respect to elements falls down the group, but the stability with
respect to the oxide increases. With a large cation, there is very little change in lattice
enthalpy  on  decomposition
(i.e.  BaCO3ÆBaO)  and  so  decomposition  is  not  very
favourable. But if you have a small cation like Mg, the large change makes the oxy acid
salt unstable.
Thermodynamics of Ionic Systems
Useful  for  explaining  stability,  e.g.  CaCO3  decomposes  at
900oC,  but  MgCO3
decomposes at 400oC.
Start by drawing the cycle:
Also, always define the decomposition temperature.
Decomposition occurs when ∆G for the reaction is negative. In this case, the ∆Sdecomp
term is dominated by the gas produced (CO2) and so is positive and effectively constant.
Note that Tdecomp is proportional to ∆Hdecomp, i.e. when ∆H is positive (endothermic),
higher temperatures of decomposition are expected.
The thermodynamic driving force is a gain in lattice energy with smaller anion. This
implies it is more important for small cations, i.e. smaller M2+ carbonates have lower
decomposition temperatures. Hence, large cations stabilise large anions, but this is NOT
because of packing.
This can be explained by using the cycle above:
MCO3: ∆HL = (A.2.2.2)/(r2++r(CO32-)).
MO:
∆HL = (A.2.2.2)/(r2++r(O2-)).
∆H1 = [ (8A/(r2++r(CO32-)) - (8A/(r2++r(O2-)) ]+ ∆H2
i.e. to stabilise MCO3 want to minimise difference in ∆HL:

As another example, consider the Group 1 Oxides.
Burning in excess O2 gives:
Li Æ Li2O
Na Æ Na2O2
K Æ KO2
Cs Æ CsO2
Why? Look at thermodynamic cycles.
e.g. for Rb+O2- superoxide.
UL = 1.08x05x2x1x1 / (166+181) = 622.5 kJ mol-1.
Similarly for Rb+2O22-.
UL = 1825 kJ mol-1.
∆Hdec = 2∆HL(RbO2) - ∆HL(Rb2O2) + ∆Hf(O22-) - 2∆Hf(O2-).
∆Hdec = 2(622.5) - 1825 + 520 - 2(-105) = 150 kJ mol-1.
Assume entropy of any solid is identical and insignificant, compared with entropy of gas.
∆Sdec = So(g) = 205 J K-1 mol-1.
This then allows the decomposition temperature to be calculated.
Comparison of Properties of Group 1 and Group 2
All are soft light metals.
Very reactive. Strong reducing agents.
Group 2 tend to be more stable with respect to elements (e.g. Nitrides). This is due
mainly to higher charge, which gives a higher lattice enthalpy:
Comparing Cs and Ca compounds - CsF2 / CaCl both stable wrt elements.
e.g. CsF2(s):
∆Hf = 2694 - 2(-271) - ∆HL

∆HL = (c.2.1.3)/(r++133)

2F-
Hence, predict r(Cs2+) ≈ 150pm.
Thus, ∆HL = -138 kJ mol-1.
Negative ∆HL Î stable wrt the elements.
Similar calculations show that CaCl is also stable wrt to the elements.

Stability of Oxidation States:
2nd Ionisation Energies vs. Difference in Lattice Enthalpy.
For Cs, difference in ionic radii is small (167 vs. 150pm), whereas much larger difference
for Ca (170 vs. 100pm), due to loss of a subshell.
Generalising, Al2+ unstable (Æ Al3+). Also, no Tl2+, Pb+, Pb3+, etc.
The change in radii is the key point (from the Kapustinskii Equation).
Similarly, Transition Metals can occupy various oxidation states because the change in
radius is small from electrons lost within d-subshell.

Also, for small ions, ∆HL ∝
Î ∆HL is large.

Solutions in Liquid Ammonia
Alkali Metals - all look bright blue in liquid ammonia.
High concentrations gives a bronze colour, and the conductivity increases to that of
molten metals.
Thus, the metals must give rise to the same species to cause the same colour, and the
actual metal does not matter. This occurs because the metal breaks down to M++e-. This
electron is then trapped in the linked NH3 molecules (H-bonding as a liquid). The gaps in
the NH3 occur as when 2-3 displace, and gives a cavity 300-350pm wide.
This is known from the absorption spectra, which is centred around the infrared region.
Thus, it appears blue, irrespective of metal.
The bronze colour appears when the concentration of M+ is so high that this electride
(electron coordinated by ammonium ions) associates with the M+ as well.
NB: these solutions require anhydrous conditions and minimal impurities to be stable,
otherwise amide formation results.
Also of note, the electride is understandably a powerful reducing agent:

RCH=CH2 + 2eam Æ RCH-CH22- Æ RCH2CH3 + 2NH2-
Stability of Complexes
Neutral ligands:
Few stable. Dependent on desolvation of the ions and also metal-ligand attraction. It is
the latter which is a problem, since a charged ligand is held more tightly. As it is, the M-L
depends on polarity, and water is extremely polar, as shown:
The   O   of   the   water   is   very
H
R
electronegative, and draws e away
M+  O

from the H, making the +/- attraction

of MO stronger. This is not the case
with the amine on the right. Thus, the
Charged ligands:

more stable H2O ligands.

This is now favourable, since the attraction of M+ + L- is much greater than a dipole
attraction.
Considering whether enthalpy or entropy drives this reaction, we note that M++X- is good
from an enthalpy point of view, but also the loss of ∆Hsolv is bad. Thus, ∆Hcomplexation ≈ 0.
However, ∆S >> 0 due to release of H2O from M+ and X-, so entropy is the driving force
for these reactions. This is especially shown by polydentate ligands, where it is possible
to free 6 water molecules for one ligand.
An extreme example of this is with crown ethers. These are in fact
uncharged, but the entropy gain is so high that it is possible. A Crown
Ether such as 18-crown-6 looks like the diagram on the right.
Unlike the amine ligand above, which can rotate and invert, this crown ether has few
degrees of freedom - it is preorganised. Thus, ∆S is much more positive.
Also worth noting is the specificity of these ligands. For example, the 2.2.1 cryptand
binds to Na+, while the 2.2.2 cryptand prefers K+. This is useful for isolation purposes.
Another isolation effect is:
cryptand
2Na Æ Na+ + Na- Æ [ Na+(crypt) Na- ].
The product is a solid containing an Na- anion.

Effects.
Organometallics
Most heavy metals form very reactive ionic compounds with alkyls, and so don’t last very
long. However, the strong polarising nature of Li, Be and Mg mean that covalently
bonded structures are possible.
Synthesis:
2 Li + RX Æ LiR + LiX
This is carried out in ether, and is otherwise in inert conditions. The yield is often poor
due to a reaction between LiX and LiR again. Careful choice of RX is required. HgR2
works well.
LiBu + PhI Æ PhLi + BuI
Also, Grignard Reagents can be formed:
Mg + RX Æ RMgX
Structures:
Most lithium alkyls exist as hexameric structures, and have similar properties to most
covalent structures. The extended structures means they are usually soluble in organic
solvents.
Solution Equilibria:
From the point of view of Grignard Reagents, a series of equilibrium structures are
possible. The following diagram shows this:

Biological Roles of Pre-Transition Metals
No redox chemistry, which would be problematic in biological systems. This is because
there is no variable oxidation state. For example, the presence of Cu+ could cause O2 to
form OH radicals, which then damage DNA.
Other advantages are that they are often not strong Lewis Acids (preventing Acid
catalysis, or harmful pH conditions). This usually means they are poor catalysts. Also,
since they are highly soluble, they can behave as electrolytes, and aid charge balance
(particularly Na and K).

Na+
Important in nerve function in animals. Sodium channels carry an impulse along a nerve
fibre, due to solubility and charge balance. Also used to balance concentration gradients
in extracellular fluid.
K+
Similar to Na. Intracellular fluid concentration maintenance. Essential for nerve impulse
transmission and cardiac function.
Mg2+
Essential for chlorophyll function, so all green plants depend on it. Also has enzyme
activating properties in all animals.
Ca2+
Structural component - shells, bones, cell walls. Involved in blood clotting - enzyme
activator. Also essential in muscles and nerve synapses.
Similarities between Groups - Li and Be
These elements have properties which often don’t fit well with the others in their groups,
because of their small size.
For example, LiF is very insoluble compared with other alkali metal fluorides. This is due
to very high lattice enthalpy. As noted earlier, Li is the only G1 element capable of
forming a solid with N3-, again because of its tendency to form structures with high lattice
enthalpies.
Be is even more unlike its relatives. In fact, as is true with many periodic arrangements,
the properties of Li are related to Mg (diagonally down to the right). Be is similar to Al in
that respect, and this is true when noting that Be forms mainly covalent structures. A
good example is [Be4O(acetate)6], a large covalent complex structure which solvates in
organic solvents. The Be4O is tetrahedrally arranged, with Be continuing its extended
covalent bonding around a central O atom.
