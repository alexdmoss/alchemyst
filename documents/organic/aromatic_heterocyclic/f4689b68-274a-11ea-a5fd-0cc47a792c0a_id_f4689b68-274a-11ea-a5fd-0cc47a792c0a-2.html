AROMATIC & HETEROCYCLIC CHEMISTRY
Aromatic Chemistry
Aromaticity
This confers an energetic stability over the equivalent double bond system. This can be
explained from an MO point of view. The Huckel Rule states that planar monocyclic
conjugated hydrocarbons are aromatic when the ring contains (4n+2)π electrons.
Huckel MO Theory (HMO) is used for conjugated planar molecules, both cyclic and
acyclic. It is based on the approximation that the σ framework does not interact with the
π-orbitals (orthogonal), and it can be used to calculate relative energies of MOs.
Aromaticity -
•   Planar, fully conjugated, cyclic polyenes.
•   Generally more stable than their acyclic analogues.
•   As the number of π electrons increases, generally get more reactive.
•   Bonds normally of nearly the same length.
•   In a magnetic field, a ring current is set up (observable by NMR).
•   Ability to undergo electrophilic substitutions.
Electrophilic Substitution
Evidence for this mechanism lies in the isolation of intermediates, and also kinetic
isotope effects (Step 1 is usually rate determining).
Nitration
-
HNO3 + 2H2SO4 forms NO2+.
Sulphonation
-
H2SO4 forms SO3 at 80oC.
Halogenation
-
X2 + Lewis Acid.
Alkylation and Acylation
-
Friedel-Crafts Reaction. Alkyl/Acyl Chloride + AlCl3.

Note that alkylation typically runs to completion by substituting three times, whereas
acylation shows less tendency to do this.
Formylation can be effected by adding HCl and CO with catalytic AlCl3. Other methods
include:
Vilsmeier Reaction
Hoesch Synthesis
Regiochemistry
From a purely statistical point of view we might expect the ratio of ortho:meta:para
products to be 2:2:1 based on the number of available sites. However, the nature of the
substituent group has a major effect on the ratio of products.
Electron-withdrawal by a halide (Inductive Effect, -I) has a slight effect, but it diminishes
rapidly with distance, and is typically outweighed by mesomeric (resonance) effects. The
same is true for electron-donation (slight with alkyls).
Mesomeric effects can be electron donating or electron withdrawing as well.
We see that for electron withdrawing groups, this favours meta.

A positive charge is placed next to the ortho and para positions, so the internal energies
for these intermediates will be higher
(i.e. the reaction profile has higher energy
transition states) than that of the meta, and they are formed more slowly.
In contrast, mesomerically donating groups share the positive charge at the ortho and
para positions more effectively than at the meta, so their energy profiles are lower in
energy than for the meta, and so favoured.
Ipso Substitution
Summary of Substituent Effects
For EDG - generally ortho/para directing. All activated wrt benzene.
For EWG - meta directing. Deactivating wrt benzene.
Steric Factors
All things being equal, a third group is least likely to enter between two meta groups.
Ortho  Rule:  when  an  m-directing  group  is  meta  to  an  o/p-directing  group,  then
electrophile goes ortho to the m-directing group rather than para.

Other Selectivity
Worth remembering Kinetic vs. Thermodynamic Control, especially with fused rings
(disruption of both rings’ aromaticity vs. steric effects in the product).
Nucleophilic Substitution
Requires strong electron withdrawal from the ring for initial attack. The intermediate is
often called the Meisenheimer
(σ) complex, and the Nucleophile attacking is rate
determining.
Aryne Formation
Can also deprotonate the ring with strong base such as -NH2 (imagine H in place of F in
the above) giving rise to the same benzyne intermediate (highly reactive). In the case of
-NH2 deprotonation the NH2 typically acts as a nucleophile attacking the benzyne
intermediate (at either end of the triple bond). This is typically called cine substitution.
Unimolecular
This occurs e.g. with diazonium salts, where the N2 falls off the benzene ring (rate
determining), leaving C6H5+, which is then attacked by a nucleophile (fast).
Radical Reactions
Ph• formation
Via Electron Transfer

Propagation: process becomes a chain reaction if radical generated by leaving group
expulsion reacts with nucleophile to give a radical anion capable of sustaining the chain.

The  forward  process  is  known  as  the  Paal-Knorr  Synthesis.  This  is  a  very
straightforward  synthesis  limited  only  by  the  accessibility  of  the
1,4-dicarbonyl
precursors.
This synthesis can similarly be applied to thiophenes, e.g.
When H2S is used as the heteroatom source the mechanism is similar to the pyrrole
above.
With Phosphorus(V) Sulphide, the situation is slightly different:
With furans, simple dehydration suffices to form the ring (i.e. no need to add one H
2O
molecule to then condense out two!).
The most common method for pyrrole synthesis, however, is the Knorr Synthesis. This is
the condensation of a ketone with an α-aminoketone via an enamine:
α-aminoketones can be prepared by nitrosation of an active methylene group followed
by reduction of the oxime to the amine:
This is facilitated by R2 being electron-withdrawing (enhances the electrophilic nature of
the ketone carbonyl and increases rate, preventing self-condensation).

Electrophilic Substitutions
Generalised mechanism:
Ease  of  this  reaction  pyrrole
>  furan
>  thiophene
>  benzene.  Reflects  order  of
aromaticity (i.e. thiophene is more aromatic, so more stable to reaction).
Classic example of this reaction is the Vilsmeier Formylation of reactive aromatic
compounds:
Many similar reactions can be performed, e.g. the Mannich Reaction. Friedel-Crafts can
only be used on thiophenes, as pyrroles and furans are not stable to the Lewis Acid
conditions required. However, the presence of Electron Withdrawing Groups on the ring
stabilise them, so that it can be performed, e.g.

Anion Chemistry
Useful reactions as a result:
Oxazoles, Imidazoles and Thiazoles
Synthesis
For oxazoles, the Robinson-Gabriel Synthesis is used:
Dehydration can be carried out by a wide range of acids, such as phosphoric acid,
phosgene or thionyl chloride. The mechanism is as follows:

There are several ways of preparing imidazoles. Condensation of a 1,2-dicarbonyl
compound with ammonium acetate and an aldehyde is common:
For thiazoles, the Hantzsch Synthesis is used:
Electrophilic Substitution
1,3-azoles are not very reactive to electrophilic attack due to the deactivating effect of
the pyridine-like Nitrogen. Electron-donating groups can facilitate this reaction though:
Anion Chemistry
The C2 position is particularly electron-deficient, so deprotonation here allows a wide
variety of useful reactions to be carried out:
Nucleophilic Substitution
As  a  consequence  of  lower  electrophilic  reactivity,  these  are  more  reactive  to
nucleophiles. They require no activation with EWG like furans etc:

Isoxazoles, Pyrazoles and Isothiazoles
Synthesis
Isoxazoles and pyrazoles are synthesised in much the same way. The mechanism is:
Hence, generalising,
Another important method of synthesis for isoxazoles involves [3+2] cycloaddition of
nitrile oxides:
Isothiazoles are usually prepared by routes involving formation of the N-S bond in the
cyclisation step. This is often set up by oxidation of the Sulphur atom, as in the following:
Electrophilic Substitution
Less reactive than furan etc due to pyridine-like N present. It still occurs though, and
principally at the C4 position, similar to the meta selectivity of pyridines.

Anion Chemistry
Deprotonate at C5 and then quenched with electrophiles, as previously:
Note that this does not happen with isoxazoles, because the intermediate anion is
unstable:
These can be deprotonated on attached alkyl groups however.

Electrophilic Substitution
Pyridine is virtually inert to aromatic electrophilic substitution. Its basic properties and the
stabilisation conferred by the N atom mean that even nitration at the 3 position is
arduous and low yielding.
However, pyridine can be activated by conversion to pyridine N-Oxide, and the O can
subsequently be removed after the reaction is complete.
For example:
They can also be converted into synthetically useful 2-chloropyridines:
Another approach to electrophilic substitution involves the chemistry of 2-pyridone and
4-pyridone, which are tautomers of the hydroxypyridine.
These react with electrophiles at the ortho and para positions to the activating O atom.

Nucleophilic Substitution
Pyridines can be attacked at the C2/C6 and the C4 positions:
These are much more facile when better leaving groups are present:
Some example reactions:

Deprotonation at C2/C6 and C4, for the same reasons as the nucleophilic attack
locations. These then react with a range of nucleophiles:

Quinolines and Isoquinolines
Synthesis
The classic synthesis of quinolines is the Skraup Synthesis, which proceeds as follows:
The key intermediates in the synthesis of isoquinolines are β-arylethylamines. This is the
Bischler-Napieralski Synthesis:
To achieve aromaticity from the product of this reaction, a Pd0 catalyst is used to
dehydrogenate.
Electrophilic Substitution
These occur more easily than in pyridine, but the reaction occurs on the benzene ring as
opposed to the pyridine.

Nucleophilic Substitution and Anion Chemistry of quinolines are analogous to pyridines.
Indoles
Synthesis
Fischer Indole Synthesis:
Note the pericyclic step in the mechanism.
Some examples:
Electrophilic Substitution
This is facile in the electron-rich heterocycle, occurring preferentially at the C3 position.

Also, like pyrrole, Mannich-type reactions are easy:
Vilsmeier Reaction is also suitable as above.
Anion Chemistry
Deprotonates at the N unless this is “protected” by reaction with an alkyl, in which case
C2 is deprotonated.
