ORGANOMETALLICS IN SYNTHESIS:
CHROMIUM, IRON & COBALT REAGENTS
Introduction to Metal-Carbon Bonding
Organometallic chemistry involves the interaction of an organic compound with a transition metal
unit to form an intermediate complex. These may or may not be stable, but often have properties
and undergo reactions that are quite different to the parent organic compound.
Before we consider the properties of such complexes, think about the bonding involved between
a metal and an organic ligand.
The 18 electron rule:
•   Derives from a desire to achieve a stable configuration - all bonding orbitals full.
•   In order to assess the number of electrons contained within a complex, count electrons
on the free metal, add the electrons from the ligands, and consider the charges (see
Inorganic Organometallics Notes for details).
Details of M-C Bonding
CO Bonding
Chatt-Dewar-Duncanson Model: Carbon donates a lone pair of electrons to an empty orbital on
the metal, while the metal donates electrons from a filled orbital into antibonding CO orbitals. See
Inorganic Organometallics Notes for pictures. The result of this is that CO is very electron
withdrawing.
Bonding to π Ligands
A   similar   situation   to   the   above   occurs   with   these,   e.g.   alkenes
(again,   Inorganic
Organometallics Notes for pictures).
Arene-Chromium Tricarbonyl Chemistry
Formation of ArCr(CO)3 Complexes
Heating an aromatic complex with chromium hexacarbonyl in dibutyl ether results in the formation
of a complex between the aromatic ring and the transition metal. Electron-rich arenes complex
the best and strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g. nitro, keto) are incompatible. Schlenk lines
should be used.
Moderately air
stable
Decomplexation occurs with an oxidant (O2 or CAN - (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6.
The key features of these complexes are:
1)   Inductive - e-withdrawing.
2)   Steric - size of tricarbonyl groups.
3)   Stereochemistry - can be chiral - can influence stereoselectivity.
4)   Neighbouring Group Participation - stability of benzylic cations.

This diagram sums up all chromium-arene chemistry, and is brought about by the electron-
withdrawing nature of the Cr(CO)3 group.
Reactivity
Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution of Aryl Halides
Although simple aryl halides are relatively inert to nucleophilic aromatic substitution, when
complexed to chromium, this reaction is greatly facilitated.
These substitution reactions all proceed by a two step process, involving nucleophilic attack of
the arene ring from the face opposite the metal, forming an anionic η5-cyclohexadienyl complex,
followed by rate-limiting loss of the halide from the endo side of the ring.
The displacement of halide by carbanions is limited to stabilised carbanions capable of adding
reversibly to the complexed arene. More reactive carbanions, such as 2-lithio-1,3-dithiane, attack

- 3 -
the complexed arene ortho and meta to the halide, producing η5-cyclohexadienyl complexes
which cannot directly lose chloride, and furthermore, cannot rearrange to the η5-cyclohexadienyl
complex (which can). Stabilised carbanions also initially attack ortho and meta to chloride, but the
addition is reversible such that eventually attack at the halide-bearing position occurs, followed by
loss of halide (substitution).
Addition of Carbon Nucleophiles to Arenechromium Complexes
A range of stabilised carbanions attack from the face opposite the metal, producing anionic η5-
cyclohexadienyl complexes.
With substituted aromatics, under conditions of kinetic control, the regioselectivity is that expected
for nucleophilic aromatic substitution (meta to e-donating groups, para to acceptor groups) and
predicted by the assumption that the frontier MOs are arene-centred. Ortho addition occurs with
groups capable of coordinating the incoming nucleophile (e.g. imines). In contrast to benzene-
Cr(CO)3 complexes, for which MeLi and n-BuLi react by deprotonation, these reagents add to
phenylmethaneimine or similar. Note also that replacement of an electron-withdrawing CO ligand
with a ligand such as phosphine (e-donating) decreases the reactivity of arene complexes
towards nucleophilic attack.
Very reactive carbanions, such as dithiane lithium or phenyllithium, add irreversibly to the
complexed arene. The resulting anionic η5-cyclohexadienyl complexes are relatively stable and
can sometimes be isolated. Oxidation of these complexes generates the alkylated arene,
protonolysis  generates  mixtures  of  isomeric  cyclohexadienes,  and  reaction  with  carbon
electrophiles produces trans disubstituted species. In contrast, stabilised carbanions add to
complexed  arenes  reversibly,  and  are  always  in  equilibrium with  the  starting  compounds.
Reaction with carbon electrophiles results in regeneration of the starting arene complex and
alkylation of the electrophile by the stabilised carbanion, as shown in the equation above.
Both the activating and the directing effects of complexation to chromium are synthetically useful.
For example, allows nucleophilic substitution at indoles, and permits reaction to occur at the
usually inaccessible C4 (or indeed C7 with a bulky substituent at C3).
Protolytic  cleavage  of  the  η5-cyclohexadienyl  complexes  resulting  from  alkylation  of  η6-
arenechromium tricarbonyl complexes produces cyclohexadienes rather than arenes.

- 4 -
The ability of chromium to activate arenes, direct the attack, and to permit protolytic cleavage of
the η5 complex to produce cyclohexenones has been used below:
Again, protons are the only electrophile that cleaves the η5 complex. Since most alkylations are
reversible, other electrophiles react preferentially with the free carbanion.
More Examples:
Lithiation of Arenechromium Tricarbonyl Complexes
Chromium activates the ring to lithiation too.
Arenes with substituents with lone pairs (MeO, Cl, etc) gives lithiation always ortho to the
substituent. Complexed indoles are lithiated in the normally unreactive 4-position, provided a
large protecting group is present on the nitrogen to suppress lithiation at the 2-position.

Also,

Electrophiles approach anti to it:
In fact this effect is noticeable at centres that are doubly removed from the ring.

- 6 -
Activation of the Benzylic Position
This is another manifestation of the electron-withdrawing properties of the Cr(CO)3 group -
stabilises negative charge at the benzylic position.
Unusually, however, chromium also stabilises positive charge in the benzylic position. This is
thought to be due to stabilisation by a “through-space” interaction with the metal-bound carbonyl
groups and/or filled metal d-orbitals. First discovered when:
Consider an energy diagram for the reaction: a fast S

So double inversion leads to retention:
Now consider the ionisation of this acetal:
The following experiment shows 2 things - 1) only OEt is hydrolysed, which validates the
mechanism, and 2) it is stereoselective.

This allows useful synthetic transformations:
Steric Effects
The chromium tricarbonyl fragment completely blocks one face of the arene, so that reactions
occur from the face opposite the metal. This can result in a very high degree of stereocontrol, and
hence the use in organic synthesis. For example:
Removal of an activated benzylic proton permitted intramolecular alkylation of the keto group,
resulting in clean cis-stereochemistry from the opposite face of the metal.
It is also possible to obtain facial selectivity by complexation to e.g. OH groups, e.g.

- 9 -
Unsymmetrically 1,2- and 1,3-disubstituted arenechromium tricarbonyl complexes are chiral and
are enantiomeric on the basis of which face of the arene the chromium tricarbonyl fragment
occupies. Known as planar chirality - chirality resulting from the arrangement of out-of-plane
groups with respect to a reference plane (the chiral plane). This allows highly enantioselective
reactions:
Complexation of XYC6H4 will give a racemic mixture (addition to both enantiotopic faces). But,
there are a number of methods available for the formation of single enantiomers by resolution or
asymmetric synthesis. We can use this chirality to influence the formation of new chiral centres,
i.e. stereoselective synthesis.
Consider addition to the following aldehyde:

- 10 -
Planar chiral arene-Cr(CO)3 complexes can also be generated by diastereoselective reactions.
For example, α-lithiation of the Cr(CO)3 complex below occurs almost exclusively at one of the
two diastereotopic ortho positions, and the resulting carbanion alkylates aldehydes almost
exclusively from a single face.
Also, diastereoselective nucleophilic addition ortho to a chiral hydrazone group gollowed by
hydride abstraction and removal of the chiral auxiliary gives the planar chiral benzaldehyde
complexes with high enantiomeric excess:
Organo-Iron Reagents
Cationic olefin complexes of iron(II) are easily made by alkene exchange with the stable
CpFe(CO)2(isobutene)+ complex which is a stable gold-yellow solid, made by reaction of Fp- (Fo
= CpFe(CO)2) with methallyl bromide, followed by γ-protonation. Once complexed, the olefin
becomes reactive to nucleophilic attack, sharing most of the reactivity, regio- and stereochemical
features of the neutral olefin Pd(II) complexes. However, the main difference is the stability of the
σ-alkyl iron(II) complex, such that the iron must be removed in a separate chemical step, usually
oxidation.
Formation / Decomplexation
Not surprisingly, iron forms metal tricarbonyl complexes with dienes (Cr d6, Fe d8). Reaction of a
diene with di-iron nonacarbonyl forms a complex. The diene must be conjugated, and also
capable of existing in the s-cis conformation:

The iron has 8 + (3x2) + 4 = 18 electrons.
Skipped dienes may also react indirectly:
And decomplexation can be effected with an oxidant:
Protecting / Stabilising
Firstly, this derivative can be used as protecting group for a diene.
And, in addition, complexation to iron can confer stability on a reactive diene.
Steric Influence
Also, reagents prefer to add opposite to the bulky Transition Metal.

Cyclohexadienyl Cationic Complexes of Iron
The iron-tricarbonyl diene unit is capable of stabilising adjacent carbocations (cf. Cr). Prepared
from the diene complexes by 2 main methods:
1) Adjacent leaving group:
2) Reaction of trityl cation on a diene complex:
These complexes are capable of reaction with a variety of different nucleophiles. All these attack
ANTI to the large Fe(CO)3unit.
The regioselectivity of attack is governed by electronic considerations:

Mechanism for diimide reduction:
The Nicholas Reaction
Nicholas discovered that cations α to these complexes were particularly stable. In fact some may
be isolated as crystalline solids.
This is due to electron donation from the e-rich cobalt atoms to the cationic centre.
Once formed, these cations undergo smooth reaction with a variety of nucleophiles. The
advantages that cobalt confers upon this process are manifold. The reaction can be:

Although the largest group on the alkyne ends up adjacent to the carbonyl in the product, the use
of unsymmetrical alkenes gives mixtures.
Solutions to this problem usually involve a tether between the alkyne and alkene so only one
regioisomers is possible.
Amine-N-Oxides promote the oxidation of a CO ligand to CO2. Mechanism:
Recently, the advent of mild conditions which involve Me3NO or heating on silica mean that the
reaction is an extremely useful one for synthesis. There is also some progress on a catalytic
