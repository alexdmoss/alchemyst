REACTIVE INTERMEDIATES NOTES
Carbenes
These are neutral, divalent, highly reactive carbon intermediates. The two non-
bonding electrons can be arranged parallel or spin-paired. Spin-paired show both
electrons an sp2 orbital, leaving the p orbital vacant. This is the singlet state. The
triplet state shows both electrons with parallel spins and leaves one electron in an
sp2 orbital and the other in a p orbital, and this is the triplet state.
Structure -
Evidence of this is provided by UV, IR, and particularly ESR.
Stability -
Generation -
There are several methods for generation of carbenes, which are listed below.

The most common method is α-elimination. This can be modified to generate
carbenoids:
Carbenes undergo many reactions.
Cycloaddition -
1,2-addition of carbenes to alkenes to form cyclopropanes. This is basically addition
to a double bond.
The Skell Hypothesis states that a singlet carbene can add to a double bond in a
single step and is stereospecific, while the triplet carbene cannot since it is spin
forbidden:
It should also be noted that in addition to allenes, the singlet carbene will add at the
more substituted double bond, while triplet at the less substituted.
Carbenes will also add to alkynes (although less readily, since alkynes are less
nucleophilic than alkenes), and to arenes. The latter generates a 7-membered ring
with 3 double bonds:
A similar molecule could be attacked by carbenes itself, e.g.
One particular mechanism is the Riemer-Tiemann Reaction:
Insertion -
Characteristic reaction of carbenes to insert into a single bond, often C-H. Again two
mechanisms can be conceived depending on spin:

This is often termed hydrogen abstraction as well.
It only occurs with very reactive carbenes, and often shows poor regioselectivity.
Rearrangement -
The vacant p-orbital allows for easy rearrangement to occur in a similar way to
Carbocations:
This is very fast. R is usually a H (C-C is very rare).
Wolff Rearrangement of diazoketones to ketenes is a famous mechanism, and
occurs as:
The Eschenmoser Rearrangement also involves carbenes:
Reaction with Nucleophiles -
Common since carbenes are very electron deficient.
Carbenoids
Similar to carbenes, but involve a metal bonded to the carbene. Some of their
reactions include:

α-halo-organometallics
Simmons-Smith Cyclopropanation
Nitrenes
Six-electron, neutral, monovalent, highly reactive intermediates. The N atom has 4
non-bonded electrons. There are triplet and singlet states, as for carbenes.
They  are  isoelectronic  with  carbenes,  but  have
6  π  electrons  instead.  Similar
chemistry is seen, although on the whole they are more reactive.

They undergo the same sort of reactions as carbenes, and often with the same
mechanisms, although obviously generating C-N bonds instead.
Some reactions:
Addition  to  C=C  (as  for  carbenes).  Have  to  watch  for  competing
1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition with azides.
Insertion (as for carbenes).
Rearrangements -
1,2-shift (as for carbenes).
Acyl azide - concerted with nitrene formation.
Under heat Î no acylnitrene.
One other particular reaction that they are useful for is ring closure:

Rearrangements Which Probably do not involve Nitrene Intermediates
Other Rearrangements involving Electron Deficient Nitrogen
Arynes
Ortho-benzyne can take either singlet or triplet diradical structures, but is typical
drawn as a simple Lewis structure:
Most of the chemistry follows the alkyne structure, as opposed to the singlet or triplet
diradical. It can be stabilised by complexing to transition metals.
Meta and Para benzynes are also known, although these require the diradical form.
A classic reaction of para-benzyne is the Bergman Cyclisation:

There are a number of methods of generating Arynes. Some of these are:
Aryl anions typically require abstraction of a halide from the benzene ring. A strong
base will be present.
Zwitterions usually involve the loss of N2 via attack by NH2 on HONO or similar:
Fragmentation is thermodynamically favourable if the fragments are highly stable,
e.g. CO2 or N2 formed. This also applies for oxidative fragmentation, as in:
In terms of reactivity, Arynes are actually electron-deficient and highly electrophilic as
a result. They are classed as “soft” due to low lying LUMOs and highly polarisable
orbitals.
They react as:
They also react in cycloaddition reactions, although this requires the absence of any
nucleophiles because the reaction above is extremely facile. This reactions such as
Diels-Alder can be observed. They will also react with alkenes in a similar way:
Of further note, 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is evident:
