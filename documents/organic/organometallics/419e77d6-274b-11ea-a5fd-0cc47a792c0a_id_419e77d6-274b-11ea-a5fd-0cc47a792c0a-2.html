ORGANOMETALLICS NOTES
Metallated Saturated Hydrocarbons
Lithium Reagents
BuBr + 2Li Æ BuLi + LiBr, in Et2O @ -20oC.
Framework Structure -
Main use is as a strong base. This is enhanced by co-solvents such as HMPA, which
coordinates the Li leaving monomeric Bu-.
Examples -
Grignard Reagents
These are both basic and nucleophilic. Reactivity depends on the Schlenk Equilibrium:
2MeMgBr Ù Me2Mg + MgBr2
MgBr2 coordinates to E+, making it more susceptible to attack by nucleophilic Me-.
Metallated alkanes attack carbonyls readily, forming the alcohol after workup. Side
reactions do tend to occur, for example deprotonation α to C=O, or β-H transfer (if the
organometallic reagent has one).

Stereochemistry
In conformationally locked ketones the less hindered face of the carbonyl group is
attacked:
The two faces of a carbonyl compound with an α-chiral centre are diastereotopic and
hence nucleophilic addition to such compounds can lead to two diastereomeric products.
Cram’s Rule is a way of predicting which of the two faces is preferentially attacked.
Although there is free rotation about the single bond between the carbonyl and the α-
carbon, when applying Cram’s Rule we say that certain conformations will be more
reactive and these will be used to predict the major product. When the α-carbon has
three groups which may be classified as small (S), medium (M) and large (L), then the
most reactive conformation is where the groups are staggered such that the carbonyl
oxygen is between the large and medium groups (Felkin-Anh). Nucleophilic attack
occurs anti to the large group to give the major product diastereoisomer. The other face
of the carbonyl is attacked in a more hindered, staggered conformation in which the
carbonyl oxygen lies between a large and a small group, leading to the minor isomer:
In these two conformations the most important steric interactions are determined by the
R group which prefers to lie between the large and small groups rather than between the
large and medium groups:
Attack on a different conformation may be preferred when one of the substituents on the
α-carbon has a lone pair, which may coordinate to the organometallic reagent. Here the
carbonyl  group  and  the  coordinating  substituent  are  held  syn-periplanar  by  a

membered chelate ring. Attack by the nucleophilic then occur preferentially from the less
hindered side:
This can give rise to particularly stereoselective reactions:
Preferentially nucleophilic attack on a third type of preferred conformation is encountered
when the α-carbon has an electronegative substituent (e.g. halide). The most stable
conformation  places  the  dipoles  of  the  carbon-oxygen  and  carbon-halide    bonds
antiperiplanar to one another and attack occurs on the less hindered side of the carbonyl
group:
Other Reactions
They also attack esters and amides. One equivalent gives the ketone, but more allows
further reaction to give the alcohol.
They will also attack CO2
(carboxylating the alkane), and similar attack CS2 and
carbonates. Ketenes and isocyanates are also readily attacked, forming the ketone and
secondary amide respectively.

Alkylation of metallated alkanes is complicated by metal exchange (especially for alkyl
halides) and particularly subsequent elimination after attack.
Organocuprates
Also attack α,β-unsaturated ketones to give the enolate (i.e. 1,4 attack) - very useful.
Stereochemistry -
Also,

Cis product formed, as the cis-fused 5,6 ring is much more stable.
Organozinc & Organocadmium
These are both less reactive. They will not attack esters, and barely react with ketones
(Zn slowly reacts with the latter, while Cd does not).
Metallated Alkenes & Alkynes
For Li, these are made by transmetallation, addition of BuLi (or similar), or the Shapiro
(and similar) reactions. Grignards can be made by the same method as for alkanes.
They both give rise to vinyl carbanion-like reagents.
They are less basic than the alkanes, so are primarily nucleophiles. This is useful
synthetically:
Note the retention of stereochemistry:
Vinylaluminium reagents are also widely used. They undergo stereoselective cis-addition
of trialkylalanes with acetylene derivatives:
These then react in various ways, such as stereoselective protonation:
Similarly with halogens, to give vinyl halides.

They also undergo nucleophilic substitution:
Also, nucleophilic addition to carbonyls just like other organometallics
(C=O more
electrophilic than the halogens/halides above).
Metallated Alkynes are similarly
(in fact more so) nucleophilic, and are useful for
introducing a C≡C group into a molecule.
Metallated Aromatics & Heterocycles
Benzene can be metallated thermodynamically, but the reaction is usually very slow.
Hence, these are most efficiently prepared from phenyl halides, in analogous manners to
other organometallics.
A particularly useful synthetic reaction is ortho-lithiation:
Electron withdrawing Y groups or those with lone pairs control the ortho stereochemistry
by coordinating Li. It also helps if the Y group is stable wrt nucleophilic attack (e.g.
sulphonamides).

Also, benzyne generation:
Heterocycles such as furans, pyrroles and thiophens can be directly metallated with the
need for a halide substituent. This provides an easy way of attaching side chains to the
2-position (next to the heteroatom). Indoles etc. behave in a similar way (note that the for
unsubstituted heterocycles, whatever the type, the most acidic H is always the position
that is metallated).

If Li at the 3-position is needed, then a 3-substituted halide heterocycle is required, e.g.
Note that Pyridine can be unpredictable in its metallation:
