Structure Determination
Usually by chemical degradation, although Physical Methods can also be used.
1)   Oxidise S-S bridges with peracid.
2)   C-terminal: hydrazinolysis

Sanger Method -
Edman Method -
4)   Selective Fragmentation - add BrCN at Met residues.
5)   Protease Enzymes, e.g. trypsin (cleaves basic side chains - Lys, Arg).

Protecting Groups
1.   Easy to introduce.
2.   Protect Functional Group during amide formation.
3.   Removable without harming rest of the molecule.
4.   No loss of stereochemistry in 1-3.
α-amino Protection
Alkoxycarbonyl Protection
Also known as urethanes or carbamates. They are both amides and esters. As amides, they have
low nucleophilic reactivity at nitrogen. As esters, they have relatively low reactivity wrt acyl-
oxygen  fission,  but  they  can  be  degraded  alkyl-oxygen  fission  to  carbamic  acids,  which
decarboxylate spontaneously under practically all conditions, regenerating the parent amine.
They are also good because they are nearly immune to racemisation.
Benzyloxycarbonyl (Z)
Less reactive acylating agents (i.e. not the chloroformate) are sometimes preferred to prevent
dipeptide formation:
Hence use reagents such as:
Mildly basic or nucleophilic reagents do not generally affect the Z group at ambient temperature.
The main exception to this is hydantoin formation:
However, this is only really significant with ZXaaGly-peptides.
Mildly acidic conditions (e.g. half an hour with neat TFA in an ice-bath) are also without effect.
This  allows  it  to  be  carried  through  synthesis  with  more  acid-labile  protecting  groups
(orthogonality).
Cleavage conditions are HBr/AcOH or catalytic hydrogenolysis. HBr/AcOH proceeds by an SN2-
like mechanism:
The conditions are quite severe though, but most peptides survive it undamaged, unless
susceptible side-chains are present. This is usually due to the generation of electrophilic species
such as benzyl cations which attack electron-rich side chains (e.g. Trp, Tyr, Met). Additives like
These Notes are copyright Alex Moss 2003. They may be reproduced without need for permission.
 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




anisole and DMS diminish this difficulty by acting as “scavengers” for such species. Increasing
the acidity of the conditions tends to favour an SN1 mechanism, where electrophile generation is
more of a problem. Typical Scavengers are triethyl silane (Et3SiH), which is attacked by CF3COO-
and donates its H to the electrophile, converting it to a harmless hydrocarbon.
Catalytic hydrogenolysis is a useful alternative providing S side-chains are not present, as the
sulphur contaminates the catalyst.
t-Butoxycarbonyl (Boc)
t-butyl chloroformate decomposes too easily to prepare Boc derivatives. The azide was used for
some time, but now the anhydride is preferred (less explosive). The only disadvantage with this is
cost.
The Boc group is completely stable to catalytic hydrogenolysis conditions, but is much more acid
labile than the Z group, so it is highly orthogonal to this.
Basic and nucleophilic reagents have no effect at all on the Boc group, even on prolonged
exposure. No hydantoin formation.
Removal is facile with TFA (either neat or diluted) at ambient temperature for about half an hour.
The t-butyl moiety ends up as isobutene unless it is trapped by a nucleophile, so scavengers are
often added (these are essential if sensitive residues such as Trp are present). Mineral acids
attack Boc groups rapidly, and must be avoided in acidification and wash procedures (use citric
acid wash - weak acid and does not extract into organic solvents from water).
2-(4-biphenylyl)-isopropoxycarbonyl (Bpoc)
Even more acid labile than Boc (biphenylyl adds stabilisation to carbocation generated). Can
remove  in  the  presence  of  Boc  by  brief  treatment  with  chloroacetic  acid-dichloromethane
mixtures. It is also cleaved by catalytic hydrogenolysis.
9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)
These Notes are copyright Alex Moss 2003. They may be reproduced without need for permission.
 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




Introduced in a Schotten-Baumann manner, using FmocCl. Dipeptide formation is a risk, so
several less reactive reagents such as FmocOSu may be used.
Fmoc is very stable to acid, but cleaved swiftly under certain basic conditions. Piperidine (20% in
DMF) is the routine reagent, but fluoride ions in DMF also work. The mechanism is very rapid,
and proceeds via E1cb via the stabilised anion:
This does not affect Boc or Z groups, or most other protecting groups in fact. Fmoc is not
completely inert to catalytic hydrogenolysis, so this should be avoided for Z removal in the
presence of Fmoc.
Alloc
This is another orthogonal option. It is added using the chloroformate, but usefully can be
removed by Pd catalysts as shown.
Other Methods
There are several useful protecting groups that are not alkoxycarbonyl based.
Triphenylmethyl (trityl, Trt)
Reaction with α-amino esters gives better yields than Trt-Cl directly. However, this is sluggish, so
the following method is usually used:
The trityl group is very stable to base, very labile to acid (acetic acid of pH 4 works), and does not
survive catalytic hydrogenolysis.
Only problem is the extreme bulk can cause difficulties in peptide bond formation.
2-nitrophenylsulphenyl (Nps)
NpsCl + amino acid are not very stable in the free acid state, so they are generally isolated,
purified  and  stored  as  dicyclohexylammonium  salts.  They  can  be  liberated  by  cautious
acidification with sulphuric acid. Nps group is stable to mild base, but not to acid or catalytic
hydrogenolysis.
These Notes are copyright Alex Moss 2003. They may be reproduced without need for permission.
 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




Sulphenamides deactivate the nucleophilic reactivity at the amino nitrogen by S-N π-bonding
effects, and it is backed up the electron withdrawing NO2 substituent.
Deprotection proceeds as follows:
Dithiasuccinoyl (Dts)
Add EtOCS2Me, then ClSOCl, then aqueous acid to amino ester. The chemistry is complicated
(and smelly) but it has one advantage - it can be selectively removed by treatment with thiol RSH
and a mild base such as Et3N.
α-Carboxy Protection
The carboxy does not always need protecting (it is less nucleophilic than the amine) but often is
for solubility advantages and product isolation. The usual means of protection is esterification,
and the carboxy group can be regenerated on alkyl-oxygen fission.
Esters
Methyl and Ethyl Esters
Amino acids react with hot methanolic hydrogen chloride. Can also use thionyl chloride +
methanol. They provide good protection, surviving most peptide bond forming procedures, but as
a consequence are hard to remove. For example, HBr/AcOH does not affect them, nor does
catalytic hydrogenation. Saponification is sometimes satisfactory but has the risk of racemisation
and side reactions such as hydantoin formation. Hydrazinolysis can also be used, but not entirely
reliable either.
Side reactions are also possible at the dipeptide stage, because dipeptide methyl ester free
bases cyclise to diketopiperazines (DKPs) rather easily:
Benzyl Esters
Amino Acid + TsOH + BzlOH over heat gives H3N+CHRCO2Bzl. Driven by removal of water.
Isolated as salts, as the free bases are unstable (and prone to DKP formation, above).
They can be cleaved by hydrazinolysis or saponification, but also by catalytic hydrogenolysis,
HBr/AcOH, but not TFA. Their response to acidic media is thus similar to the Z group (also a
benzyl ester).
t-Butyl Esters
These Notes are copyright Alex Moss 2003. They may be reproduced without need for permission.
 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




These are stable in the free base for (t-butyl ester inert to nucleophilic and basic attack). The
stability and lability of these generally parallels the Boc group, as would be expected, so TFA will
cleave it.
Phenyl Esters
The group is incompatible with standard coupling and isolation routines. It is completely stable to
acidic media (hence its development) as well as catalytic hydrogenolysis. Alkali causes cleavage
more rapidly than with methyl esters, but it is the extraordinary susceptibility to attack by the
peroxide ion which makes the method attractive. Mechanism presumably generates the peracid,
but this is unstable with the α-electron withdrawing group present, so it collapses to the desired
carboxylic acid.
Phenacyl Esters
-CO2CH2COPh. Formation by reaction of carboxylate with phenacyl bromide, BrCH2COPh. Stable
in dry acidic conditions, and removable by zinc-acetic acid (orthogonal to t-Bu and Benzyl based
protecting groups).
Peptide Bond Formation
With  very  few  exceptions,  peptide  bond  forming  procedures  involving  the  generation  and
aminolysis of reactive carboxy derivatives are employed. Activation, i.e. the attachment of a
leaving group to the acyl carbon of the carboxy component, is necessary because carboxylic
acids form salts with amines at ambient temperature.
There are three different ways of coupling along these lines:
a)   Those in which a reactive acylating agent is formed from the carboxy component in a
separate step or steps, followed by treatment with the amino component,
b)   Those in which an isolable acylating agent is formed separately, and may be purified
before aminolysis, and
c)   Those in which the acylating intermediate is generated in the presence of the amino
component, by the addition of an activating agent to a mixture of the two components.
The activation is usually achieved by reaction of the carboxy component with an electrophilic
reagent, either by adding:
Or by substitution:

 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




Activation and Coupling
Acyl Chlorides and Fluorides
Conversion of acylamino acids to acyl chlorides, followed by reaction
with amino acids or esters under Schotten-Baumann conditions is an
obvious approach.
The reagents traditionally used for formation of the acyl chloride are
thionyl chloride, PCl5, or similar. These are, however, too vigorous to
be compatible with complex or sensitive substrates, and there is the
risk of cyclisation to give oxazolones and hence racemic peptides.
Z amino acid chlorides are isolable but unstable, decomposing to N-
carboxyanhydrides on warming (path a), although they cyclise to give
benzyloxyoxazolones under basic conditions (path b). This position
was altered dramatically by the discovery of Fmoc amino acid chlorides and also fluorides are
easy to prepare, and are rather stable convenient intermediates.
Fmoc amino acid fluorides can be obtained from Fmoc amino acid pyridine salts
by treatment with cyanuric fluoride, a procedure which does not disturb t-butyl
type protecting groups. Acyl fluorides are more stable than the corresponding
acyl chlorides to neutral oxygen nucleophiles such as water, and to tertiary
bases, but they show similar high reactivity to amino groups. They are of
particular value for forming peptide bonds between sterically hindered amino acids such as α-
aminoisobutyric acid (Aib).
Acyl Azides
Made from hydrazides, which are obtained by hydrazinolysis of a protected amino acid or peptide
ester, or by selective deprotection of a peptide derivative which has been constructed using a
blocked hydrazide for carboxy-terminal protection. Conversion to the azide can be achieved by
adding sodium nitrite in HCl(aq), but dry acid + nitrite ester in a dry organic solvent at lower
temperature is now preferred.
There  are  numerous  side  reactions  possible  with  this  procedure  though
(e.g.  Curtius
rearrangement to RNCO), so the azide method has not been used routinely for stepwise peptide
building for a while. It remained a technique for segment condensation, as the procedure is free
from racemisation. Racemisation only ever occurs with excess base in polar solvents, but it
remains the least likely method for this to occur.
Anhydrides
Symmetrical Anhydrides
These Notes are copyright Alex Moss 2003. They may be reproduced without need for permission.
 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




Aminolysis of these is unambiguous, but only half the carboxy component is incorporated into the
product. They are otherwise clean acylating agents, with the exception of Z-glycine derivatives
being unstable on heating or with base. They are very useful in stepwise synthesis.
Mixed Anhydrides with Carboxylic Acids
Main problems with this method are that the anhydride has two similar electrophilic sites and can
therefore undergo aminolysis ambiguously, and also these reagents tend to disproportionate,
ultimately with the same result.
However, the selectivity can be improved greatly by introducing steric hindrance and inductive
depression of electrophilicity, so as to direct the attack to the carboxy component carbonyl, as in
mixed pivalic anhydrides:
Mixed Pivalic Anhydrides are commonly used as they are stable wrt disproportionation, and can
be isolated in some cases. Pivaloyl derivatives of the amino component are occasionally
obtained, but this is not normally a serious matter, and the method is a valuable alternative to the
mixed carbonic anhydride method.
Mixed Anhydrides with Carbonic Acids
This is the most popular of the anhydride methods.
Ethyl chloroformate is commonly used, but isobutyl chloroformate is also popular. The flanking of
one of the carbonyl groups by two oxygen atoms diminishes reactivity, so that nucleophilic attack
is directed towards the carbonyl of the original carboxy component.
Low temperatures and minimal activation times are usually employed:
They can be isolated, although there is some decomposition at ambient temperature. The
timescale for these reactions is measured in hours rather than minutes. Conditions for the
minimisation of racemisation have been delineated for model cases, but the technique has not

 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




found  wide  application  for  fragment  condensation  at  racemisable  residues,  as  less  risky
procedures are available.
The value of the method lies in its speed and economy, and it has been used in repetitive
stepwise synthesis with some success, up to medium chain length. Its most common use is in
simple protected peptides in the tri- to hexapeptide range, as these have solubility properties
uncomfortably similar to those of dicyclohexylurea (making DCCI methods tiresome).
To avoid the need for separate activation and aminolysis steps, mixed ethyl carbonic anhydrides
can be generated by the reaction below of carboxylic acids with 1-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-
dihydroquinoline (EEDQ):
EEDQ can also be used as a direct coupling reagent:
Because in this technique the mixed carbonic anhydride is consumed by aminolysis as soon as it
is formed, the opportunity for the intervention of side-reactions, including racemisation, is minimal.
Workup is also simple.
Mixed Anhydrides with diphenylphosphinic acid
This method is more regioselective than the other mixed anhydrides, as aminolysis occurs
exclusively at the carbonyl of the activated amino acid residue, even when steric factors might
militate otherwise. Coupling is thus very clean and workup is simple.
Carbodiimide Reagents
Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI) has been the single most important reagent for activating
carboxy groups in peptide synthesis ever since it was reported in 1955. It can be used to
generate activated carboxy derivatives such as symmetrical anhydrides (as earlier) and active
esters (see later), or as a direct coupling reagent. In all cases, the primary activating event is
addition of the carboxy group to the carbodiimide functionality to give an O-acylisourea, which is a
potent acylating agent.
These Notes are copyright Alex Moss 2003. They may be reproduced without need for permission.
 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




Direct peptide coupling with DCCI is in principle very simple, involving mere mixing of the amino
and carboxy components with DCCI in equimolecular amounts in an organic solvent at ambient
temperature. O-acylisourea formation is rapid, leading to peptide either by immediate aminolysis
or via a symmetryical anhydride, with the concomitant formation of dicylcohexylurea.
The urea is only sparingly soluble in most solvents, so its separation is facile in solution
synthesis, while being soluble enough to remove through washing in solid phase synthesis.
However, the intermediates shown are highly reactive, and side reactions can
intervene,   especially   if   the   amino   component   is   dilatory.   Extensive
racemisation takes place with susceptible carboxy components. Furthermore,
the collapse of the O-acylisourea by intramolecular acyl transfer sometimes
competes significantly with the desired attack by external nucleophiles. When
this happens, the much less reactive N-acylurea below is formed. This can
also be formed by intermolecular reaction between the urea and a symmetrical
anhydride, especially in DMF.
N-acylurea formation not only reduces the yield, but may give rise to purification problems. This
difficulty, and the danger of racemisation, can both be greatly reduced by performing the coupling
in the presence of a suitable α-nucleophile which is able to react very rapidly with the O-
acylisourea before side-reactions can intervene. An acylating agent of lower potency is formed,
which is still reactive with respect to aminolysis, but which is more discriminating and does not
lead to racemisation or other side-reactions.
Numerous possible additives, which in effect generate an active ester in situ, are used. N-
hydroxysuccinimide was the first, but 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) has been the one most
regularly used so far. The recently introduced aza and monocyclic analogues HOAt and HOCt
may prove to be superior.
Phosphonium and (so-called) Uronium Reagents
Acyloxyphosphonium species react readily with nucleophiles at the acyl carbon.
These Notes are copyright Alex Moss 2003. They may be reproduced without need for permission.
 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




Benzotriazolyloxy-tris-(dimethylamino)   phosphonium   hexafluorophosphate,   alias   the   BOP
reagent, is the main one. It has the formula (Me2N)3P+--OBt,PF6-. For coupling, an equivalent of
the reagent is added to a 1:1 mixture of the amino and carboxy components, together with a
tertiary base to ensure that the latter is ionic. Many pathways are possible, but the main one is via
the ester of HOBt:
All the co-products are easily removed, and the procedure gives high yields with few side-
reactions, even in difficult cases. As the initial step is anion-cation reaction, it is favoured in less
polar solvent. It is also applicable in both solution and solid phase.
New reagents termed TBTU and HATU are replacing this on grounds of toxicity.
These   are   obtained   from   HOBt
/
HOAt   respectively,   by   reacting   them   with
tetramethylchloroformadinium cation (Me2N)2C+--Cl (made from phosgene or oxalyl chloride on
tetramethylurea).
TBTU and HATU are termed uronium salts, despite the fact that they are
actually guanidinium derivatives in the solid state. In solution the two forms
may coexist. HATU seems to be the best reagent in this class, succeeding in
sterically hindered couplings and giving minimal racemisation. The high
reactivity to amino groups is probably due to intramolecular general base
catalysis.
Mechanism -

Note that another Direct Coupling Reagent, Woodward’s Reagent K, is also often used:
Active Esters
Active esters offer excellent leaving groups attached to the carbonyl, for rapid aminolysis. They
are usually prepared by DCCI-mediated coupling:
Mixed anhydride methods can also be used, and various specialised reagents are available:
The currently popular active esters are generally crystalline, stable materials.
Because  they  are  at  a  low  level  of  activation,  side-reactions  during  coupling
(including
racemisation) are generally less of a problem than with most peptide bond forming procedures,
although there is a serious risk of racemisation when active esters are prepared directly if the
carboxy component is susceptible, especially if exposure to base is involved.
The appeal lies in the cleanliness of the reaction, allowing easy repetition which dispense with
isolation of intermediate peptides. The more reactive active esters are also valuable in solid
phase synthesis.
The reactivities of the various active esters correlates broadly with the acidities of the ester
moieties, after allowance for sterics etc. Pfp and Su are especially reactive. Co-product removal
is also a consideration.

N-carboxyanhydrides
The N-carboxy anhydrides (NCAs) of α-amino acids are easily obtained by the action of
phosgene  of  α-amino  acids,  or  by  thermal  decomposition  of  alkoxycarbonyl-α-amino  acid
chlorides. They are useful in two modes.
First, treatment with small amounts of nucleophilic initiator in an organic solvent leads to
successive ring opening and loss of carbon dioxide, giving a new nucleophile which attacks
another molecule of NCA, and so on, leading to the formation of homopolyamino acid:
Second, providing the conditions are carefully controlled, NCAs can be used for rapid peptide
synthesis in aqueous solution:
Extension to short oligopeptides is possible by repetition, e.g.
The peptides prepared via NCAs in this way are of high optical purity, and in principle the great
rapidity of the technique and the possibility of using a repetitive regime makes it very attractive.
However,  the  carbamic  acids  produced  by  aminolysis  of  NCAs  are  unstable,  and  some
decarboxylation usually occurs before the aminolysis stage is complete, giving a fresh amino
group which can react with any remaining NCA and result in “over-reaction”. Minimisation of this
and other side-reactions requires exceedingly careful control of the reaction conditions, and the
progressive accumulation of over-reaction products limits the extent to which the repetitive
approach can be taken without prohibitive purification problems.
NCAs can be N-alkoxycarbonylated in the presence of base to give urethane-protected NCAs
(UNCAs). Fmoc-NCAs, for example, are generally useful and can be kept for some time, and
react rapidly and cleanly with amino groups to give Fmoc-aminoacyl derivatives and carbon
dioxide as the only co-product:
Racemisation
In peptide chemistry this term covers not only conversion of enantiomers but also partial
epimerisation, whereby there is loss of chiral integrity at one of two or more chiral centres,
resulting in the formation of a mixture of epimers (i.e. diastereoisomers differing at one chiral
centre).

 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




It is an almost exclusively base-induced side-reaction, and in practice is only a matter for serious
concern  at  the  activation  and  coupling  stages  of  a  synthesis.  There  are  two  principal
mechanisms.
Direct Enolisation
Deprotonation at the α-carbon of an α-amino acid residue result in racemisation, because the
carbanion can reprotonate on either side:
When the group attached to the carbonyl is NH, O-alkyl or O-, it is in most cases negligible, so
deprotection is safe. During activation and coupling, however, the risk is more significant.
Racemisation is fastest when electron-withdrawing groups are in the position next to the carbonyl
(i.e. good leaving groups) and with unhindered strong bases in dipolar aprotic solvents like DMSO
and DMF. Fortunately, with the exception of a few special amino acids and couplings which are
extremely slow, the amount of racemisation which takes place is very slight.
The Oxazolone Mechanism
Activated acylamino acids and peptides cyclise under the influence of base to give oxazolones.
These are themselves activated towards aminolysis, and reaction with amino components leads
ultimately to peptides, but since their racemisation via stabilised anions is usually fast compared
to the rate of peptide bond formation, any peptide produced is largely useless.
When the amino-nitrogen of the activated residue is acylated with a simple acyl group (acetyl,
benzoyl, etc), or with a peptide chain, cyclisation to the oxazolone occurs easily with most good
leaving groups X, and gross or even complete racemisation may ensue. But oxazolone formation
is not so facile when the acyl substituent is an alkoxycarbonyl protecting group. This is vitally
important, and explains the extensive use of alkoxycarbonyl protection.
Use of Enzymes
Advantages here are the mild conditions, freedom from racemisation and the need for side-chain
protection, and scope for industrial scale-up.
Disadvantages - unpredictability. Also, not all the appropriate proteases are available, and non-
proteinogenic amino acids are obviously problematic.
Residue-Specific Considerations
Lysine
Block the ε-amino group on the side-chain prior to peptide bond formation. Can be achieved
using the fact that the side-chain amino group is the more basic and nucleophilic because there is
an electron-withdrawing group next to the α-amino group, or by taking advantage of the fact that
two α-functionalities can engage in chelate formation.

Once the amino groups have been distinguished, trivial reactions give ready access to any
required orthogonally disubstituted lysines, e.g.
Arginine
Guanidino side-chain is a strong base which remains protonated under normal conditions for α-
protection, peptide bond formation, and deprotection. Thus, it can be left unprotected. However,
may give rise to solubility problems, so protection is often carried out. The classic method is
nitration:
Note that there are risks of side-reactions in base (cyclisation).
Aspartic and Glutamic Acids
Peptide bond formation involving α-carboxy groups requires that the carboxy groups on these
side chains must be protected (obviously!). Benzyl or t-butyl ester protection is usually employed.
Differentiation of the carboxy groups is again based on reactivity - the α-carboxy is deactivated to
esterification by a nearby protonated amino group.
Main difficulties lie in the ease of cyclic imide and amide ring formation, and may be one of the
most serious side-reactions in peptide synthesis:
It is less serious with secondary and tertiary alkyl esters in the side-chain than it is with esters of
primary alcohols. 5-membered ring cyclisation is more rapid, so it is less of a problem for glutamic
acid.
Cysteine and Cystine
Unique case, due to disulphide bridge formation. Until we want these to form, the thiol groups
must  be  protected,  because  they  interfere  with  many  routine  operations.  They  are  soft
nucleophiles, so selective S-protection by direct alkylation is easy.

 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




None of the S-protecting groups are compatible with ordinary catalytic hydrogenolysis, but H2/Pd
in liquid ammonia may be used for removing Z from Cys(Bzl) derivatives. Mild acid and base α-
deprotective procedures may be used in conjunction.
Forming disulphide bridges can be carried out by oxidation of unprotected thiols, or more usually
now without deprotection, by iodine oxidation of bis-trityl peptides.
The reaction probably proceeds as follows:
For more than one disulphide bridge in a molecular, fragmentation tactics must be used, or
selective deprotection of the appropriate thiols in turn.
Methionine
This is problematic because the thioether side-chain interferes with catalytic hydrogenation, and
is  liable  to  be  attacked  by  electrophiles  generated  on  acidolytic  deprotection  of  other
functionalities. The usual response is, however, to live with it, adjusting the conditions chosen
accordingly. Protection by reversible oxidation to the sulphoxide with H2O2 is favoured by some.
Serine, Threonine, Tyrosine
Hydroxy groups, especially phenolic ones, react with acylating agents, and are therefore usually
protected in peptide synthesis. They can sometimes be left without in conditions of mild carboxy-
activation. Benzyl ether protection, cleaved by vigorous acidolysis or catalytic hydrogenolysis, or
t-butyl ether protection (TFA cleavage) are standard.
Asparagine and Glutamine
Amide side-chains are usually left unprotected, despite poor solubility and risk of side-reactions.
Trityl protection is sometimes used in conjunction with Fmoc α-protection, as it is easily removed
by mild acid at the end, but resists catalytic hydrogenolysis and base.

 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




Histidine
The basic and nucleophilic side-chain requires protection. Racemisation
is particularly prevalent, as is attack on DCCI, and formation of acyl-
imidazoles.
As shown, the trityl group is currently the protecting group of choice,
placed at the τ-position. Racemisation is still a problem due to the free
π-position.  In  conjunction  with  Boc  α-protection,  π-benzyloxymethyl
(Bom) protection is ideal - it resists TFA, but is cleaved by HF or
HBr/AcOH and (less reliably) by catalytic hydrogenolysis.
Tryptophan
The indole ring does not interfere with peptide bond formation, but captures electrophiles with
great ease at several sites, especially the 2-position, meaning scavengers for deprotection of acid
labile protecting groups are essential.
Proline
The special structure of proline gives it two impediments in synthesis
(steric hindrance to
acylation, susceptibility of Xaa-Pro bonds to reduction by sodium in ammonia), but also gives it a
resistance to base-catalysed racemisation which is unique among the chiral protein building
blocks. From a strategic point of view, this is a vital fact, because it allows any coupling from a
proline carboxy group, including an acylpeptide fragment, to be performed without racemisation.
The ordinary oxazolone racemisation mechanism pathway is not possible because they have no
NH. Cyclisation to an oxazolonium cation can take place, and such cations are optically labile, but
much more vigorous conditions are required than are ever used in peptide synthesis.
Glycine, Phenylalanine, Alanine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine
No side chain functionality. Alanine and Leucine are trouble-free.
Glycine, achiral and without any side chain, is sometimes difficult to deal with, because the
unimpeded access  to  peptide  bonds  involving  it  allows side  reactions such  as  hydantoin
formation. The same consideration facilitates strong interchain H-bonding, which tends to make
peptides with a high glycine content rather insoluble.
Phenylalanine is only a problem if catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction times are too long (is reduced
to cyclohexylalanine).
Valine and Isoleucine couple slowly (steric reasons) - allows side-reactions to compete.
Strategy and Tactics
Stepwise Elongation Strategy - e.g. for a tripeptide, [1+(2+3)] is the same as [(1+2)+3].
For a tetrapeptide, however, there are five strategies. Four of these are formally stepwise, but
one is convergent, i.e. two dipeptides are connected together. This has implications for yield.
These Notes are copyright Alex Moss 2003. They may be reproduced without need for permission.
 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




Assuming there is an 80% yield at each stage, then stepwise elongation gives a total yield of
52%, while convergent (fragment) methods gives 64%.
There are also further advantages to the fragment condensation approach. Firstly, if small
fragments are combined to make one which is larger, the differences between the desired
product and everything else ought to facilitate its isolation, whereas the addition of residues one
at a time would result only in progressive small changes in chemical character and molecular
size, with consequently greater isolation and purification problems. Secondly, in a fragment
condensation   approach,   personnel   can   be   assigned   each   of   their   fragments   to   work
simultaneously in parallel.
However, there are contrary considerations. Fragment condensation is better performed at some
positions than others, so it is a constrained strategy, and its protective group tactics are in general
more complicated than those of a stepwise synthesis strategy from the carboxy end.
For a classical solution synthesis, the optimum approach is usually stepwise synthesis of
fragments for assembly in an overall convergent strategy.
The principal strategic constraint in the desirability of proceeding in such a way as to minimise the
risk of racemisation throughout. There is no real risk except at the activated amino acid residue
during the activation and peptide bond formation stages. Furthermore, if the azide or DCCI/HOBt
procedures are used, racemisation is usually slight, with small peptides at least. The situation is
summarised more fully below:

B - Usually Safe
C - Unsafe

Advances  in  separation  technology
(e.g.  countercurrent  techniques)  are  taking  place  that
minimise these risks further.
Generalising about synthesis strategies is usually not possible. The presence of disulphide
bridges usually needs to be considered first. Problematic residues such as Met or Trp are
preferably introduced late in the synthesis. It is also wise to consider whether fragments will end
up being unreactive or insoluble.
The number and distribution of glycine and proline residues are important in the design of a
fragment condensation strategy. This is because it prevents oxazolone formation when glycine is
the C-terminus (see earlier). Also, proline locks the conformation (as does a disulphide bridge)
preventing the cyclisation. For example, a fragment strategy for AlaGlyGluMetGluOH should be
devised based on splitting between Gly and Glu, so that racemisation is avoided. Hence, Z-Ala-
Gly-OMe and Boc-Glu(OBzl)-Met-Glu(OBzl)-OMe would be combined.
N to C strategies are usually highly undesirable. This is due to the fundamental flaw that 5-
membered ring formation is favoured, i.e. oxazolone formation is a problem. Hence, carbamate
protection is preferred as this prevents this happening, i.e. want C to N strategy.
Protecting Group Tactics
Consider the target GlyLysGly, which is best approached by the stepwise strategy:

The minimum requirement is that protecting group P2 is orthogonal to P1 and P3. P2 is termed the
temporary protecting group.

Lys(Boc)Lys(Boc) insertion between two other fragments, to make -COLys(Boc)Lys(Boc)NH-,
there are a number of options:

Human Insulin
This is made up of two chains:
It is tricky to join the chains by the disulphide bridges in the correct places. A suitable synthesis is
shown below. The key features are the selective removal of a trityl in the presence of Bpoc, the
use of sulphenyl thiocarbonate method to make the unsymmetrical two-chain disulphide starting
material, and the selective formation of a disulphide bridge between two Cys(Trt) residues in the
presence of Cys(Acm).

Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis
First detailed by Merrifield in 1963. The principle is outlined below:
“Solid” phase is a little misleading - it takes place in swollen gel system produced by the
penetration of solvent and solute molecules right into the polymeric matrix. The technique has
been scaled up to industrial levels (highly automated).
The Merrifield Approach
Polystyrene cross-linked.
Main problems relate to:
a)   non-quantitative reactions.
b)   Incomplete orthogonality between the temporary blocking and permanent (which include
the polymer link).
c)   Side-reactions, especially at the final complete deprotection and cleavage from the
carrier.

 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




If any N-terminal residue of the peptide-polymer conjugate remains unacylated after any coupling
stage, this causes incomplete and inaccurate sequences. Hence, extensive washing is carried
out between each stage.
In favourable cases, coupling can be pushed to very nearly 100% by use of excess acylating
agent, or performing the stages more than once. The use of highly activated intermediates may
be advantageous. Completeness can be monitored by colour tests for residual amino groups.
Advanced separation and characterisation technology have been extremely helpful in dealing with
the difficult purification problems.
In the standard Merrifield approach, the differentiation between the temporary α-amino protection
on the one hand, and the permanent side-chain protection and peptide-resin link on the other, is
dependent on the much greater acid-lability of Boc groups than benzyl ester and related groups.
The difference is perfectly sufficient for syntheses involving a modest number of steps, but slight
side-chain deprotection of Lys(Z) residues can occur under Boc-cleavage conditions, leading to
the formation of branched peptides, and some loss of peptide from the peptide-resin conjugate
takes place at each Boc deprotection, because the benzyl ester anchor is not entirely resistant to
acidolysis.
Many biologically active peptides have an amide function at the C-terminal.

Case-Study - Bradykinin
The Sheppard Approach
In 1971 Sheppard argued that it would be desirable for the polymeric carrier to be chemically
similar to the growing peptide chain, so that both carrier and peptide could be well solvated by
dipolar aprotic solvents, to give an open gel system in which there was free access of reagents to
reactive sites. This was in contrast to the situation with peptides attached to Merrifield cross-
linked polystyrenes, where the favoured solvent for swelling the polymeric matrix (DCM) was
unable to solvate the conjugated peptide chain well and thereby encouraged its aggregation,
reducing the availability of reactive groups. Hence, polyamide carriers were introduced. Fmoc
protecting groups were also introduced in place of Boc for greater orthogonality.
The standard Sheppard carrier is derived from a cross-linked polyacrylamide incorporating a
number of sarcosine methyl ester side-chains. The side-chains are extended by treatment with
ethylenediamine,  followed  by  coupling  with  Fmoc-norleucine,  which  provides  an  internal
reference amino acid. A “linker” group or resin “handle” is added after Fmoc cleavage, and the
first protected residue of the peptide target is attached to the exposed hydroxy function on the
linker. Alternate deprotection and coupling of Fmoc residues with acid-labile side-chain protection
assembles the required sequence, which is then α-deprotected and detached from the carrier
with simultaneous side-chain deprotection, by mild acidolysis.
These Notes are copyright Alex Moss 2003. They may be reproduced without need for permission.
 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




The acid-lability of the peptide-carrier link is due to the 4-alkoxybenzyl ester. Other options are
available to suit. The α-Fmoc, ω-mild-acid-labile strategy has advantages over the Merrifield (α-
Boc, ω-strong-acid-labile) in two ways:
a)   the α/ω protection is absolutely orthogonal
b)   the final deprotection can be carried out under much gentler conditions.
Furthermore, a single solvent, DMF, is generally used at all stages, reducing the number of
washes needed, and avoiding difficulties due to swelling and contraction of the polymer with
solvent.
A common and serious problem in solid phase synthesis arises from the tendency of certain
sequences to self-aggregate on the resin. This reduces the accessibility of the N-terminal group
to reactants in solution, which interferes with coupling, deprotection, and monitoring methods
based on end-group detection. The problem usually appears after six or seven residues have
been added, when it becomes necessary to use extended reaction times, repeated reaction
cycles, extremely reactive acylating agents, or aggregation-disrupting media in order to continue
chain assembly. It is difficult to predict when this will happen (or not).

Comparison of Solid Phase & Solution Synthesis
Generally speaking, Solid Phase Synthesis is adopted for medium sizes (Sheppard generally
predominating), while proteins are assembled in solution from fragments made by Solid Phase
methods.
Solution Synthesis is harder to wash, as in the Solid anything not attached to the polymer chain is
washed away, giving a purer product. However, for the solid, must ensure 100% protection /
deprotection at each step, otherwise missing residues attach.
