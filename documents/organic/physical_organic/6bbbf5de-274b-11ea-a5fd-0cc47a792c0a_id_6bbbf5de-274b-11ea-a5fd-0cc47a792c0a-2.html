PHYSICAL ORGANIC NOTES
Kinetic Isotope Effect
The Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE) is a useful tool for establishing mechanistic pathways. It
comes about by considering the isotopic substitution of D for H in a C-H bond. This
causes a change in reaction rate which indicates the involvement of the C-H bond in the
mechanism’s rate determining step (terminal KIE).
The  effect  is  brought  about  by  the  different  vibrational
frequencies of C-H vs. C-D (lower frequency due to increased
reduced mass). Frequency is linked to energy by E= ½ hv, and
hence is linked to rate. Thus when a C-H bond breakage is
involved in the rate determining step (RDS), we see a change
in Activation Energy due to the KIE. Potential Energy is not
dependent on KIE.
Considering Primary Kinetic Isotope Effect (PKIE) - when the C-H bond is key to the
rate determining step. This gives a value of kH/kD of up to approx 7. The maximum
possible value is 8.8 at 298K, which is brought about by complete vibrational loss of a
stretch + 2 bending frequencies. The value does vary with temperature, such that as T
decreases, we would expect the ratio to increase in value.
Some examples of where PKIE would be noticeable are any mechanisms where C-H
bond dissociation is of prime importance. For example, in the oxidation of secondary
alcohols (e.g. by CrO3), the kH/kD = 7.0, indicating that C-H bond cleavage is the RDS.
Conversely, in aromatic nitration, the value drops to 1.0, implying that the RDS is
addition of NO2+, not loosing H. kh/kD > 2 usually indicates the breaking of C-H in the rate
determining step.
The magnitude of the value can indicate either reactant-like or product-like Transition
States (see Hammond Postulate below). A low pKIE implies that the C-H bond is either
nearly completely broken (close to product), or only slightly broken (close to reactant).
There are also secondary KIE’s possible. In this case the C-H bond is either α or β to the
reaction centre. The value of these is usually between 0.7 and 1.5. A value below 1
indicates an inverse KIE, i.e. the rate for C-D is faster than C-H.
The secondary KIE involves tightening or loosening of the C-H bond in the Transition
State, but not breaking. It is then labelled as either α or β depending on which carbon
the bond is formed with (α being the reaction centre).
α-SKIE results from a change in stretching frequency due to loss of CH to dominate all
other terms. The change in rate ratio is usually between 1.15 and 1.2, showing the loss
of  magnitude  compared  to  the  primary  KIE.  An  example  of  this  effect  would  be
something like:

This is typically seen for sp3Æsp2 rehybridisation (e.g. in SN1 reactions) and the factors
affecting C+ stability are usually apparent. The KIE comes about because of the
decreased resistance to bending experienced on the drop to sp2 hybridisation. This has
more effect on the freedom of the C-H bond vibration than C-D (since it is longer - see
above) so the effect is usually normal (i.e. > 1).
It is possible for inverse KIEs to occur here, e.g. the attack on a carbonyl. This is
because in the Transition State the coordination around Cα has increased, which
restricts bending. Again this affects C-H more than C-D, but this time in a negative way,
so the rate for C-D is greater because it is less destabilised.
β-SKIE is an even more remote effect. It is usually apparent due to conjugated system,
where  electrons  are  transferred  away  from  the  C-H  bond,  which  weakens  it
(hyperconjugation):
This is thus a normal KIE. An important point in this case is the conformational
dependence which can be useful, e.g. antiperiplanar alignment shows a greater effect
than SPP as the orbitals line up appropriately for a greater overlap (and hence more
hyperconjugation in effect).
Solvent KIEs are also useful. This would be for example, using D2O instead of H2O. This
is often used to determine whether the solvent is in fact a reagent, since this would give
a large PKIE. It may also have secondary effects, e.g. in exchange with acidic centres or
solvent-solute interactions (affects the energy of the Transition State).
A typical example is where protonation is involved in catalysing a reaction. D3O+ is less
stable relative to D2O (due to higher viscosity, and loss of H-bonding) when compared to
H3O+ vs. H2O (i.e. the D3O+ is a stronger acid). This means the rate is increased for D
relative to H. This leads to an inverse effect. However, H+ transfer in the rate determining
step is a primary KIE and so is favoured by H over D (a normal KIE).

Isotope Labelling Experiments may also be used to elucidate mechanism. This usually
involves ascertaining the location of a given atom in a reaction by substituting it for a
detectable element with the same properties. This is typically D or T for H, and 13C or 14C
for C. The product or trapped reagents can then be analysed using usually NMR, but
also IR/UV spectroscopy, and in the case of 14C, radioactivity measurements.
Linear Free Energy Relationships
Quantitative way of relating structure and reactivity. First showed by observing that the
rates of reaction of a series of methyl esters with NMe3 were directly related to the
ionisation constants in water of the corresponding carboxylic acids. Thus, a plot of log k
for reaction of esters against log K for ionisation of the acids gives a straight line.
Equilibrium constants and rate constants are each related to free energy changes, which
implies that there is a linear relationship between the free energy of activation for the
ester reaction and the free energy change for ionisation of the acids. This is a linear free
energy relationship (LFER).
It was also found when considering this for different isomers, that o-substituted reactants
and aliphatic compounds did not obey the linear relationship at all well, but only m and p-
substituted ones did very well. This can be explained as the m and p substituents are far
from the reaction centre and exert no steric effect on it. This is not the case for the o-
substituent or the flexible straight chain compounds. Steric effects such as this will not
be apparent in the ionisation of the carboxylic acid, only the ester reaction, so the
relationship breaks down.
The above relationship gives rise to a very important equation - the Hammett Equation,
which quantifies the LFERs. This is obtained by considering the equation of the straight
line plot, which is:
log kx = ρ log Kx + c
where ρ is the slope of the line, and c the intercept. X is the particular m/p substituent in
question.
A similar equation can be written where there is no substituent X (i.e. it is H) and this is:
log kH = ρ log KH + c
Subtracting these two equations gives:
log kx - log kH = ρ (log Kx - log KH)
Which can be rewritten:
log kx/kH = ρ log Kx/KH

- 4 -
The Hammett Equation then sets the ionisation of m and p substituted benzoic acids as
the standard reference reaction. Knowing KH and Kx for a variety of X-substituted
benzoic acids, it is then possible to define a quantity σx as:
σx = log Kx/KH
Where σx is the substituent constant, and its value remains constant for a specific
substituent in a specific position, irrespective of the reaction.
This then gives the Hammett Equation -
log kx/kH = ρσx
The reaction constant, ρ, is specific to the type of reaction being looked at. It can be
found by the gradient of the linear plot.
Physical Significance of the Substituent Constant:
This measures the electronic properties of the substituent. A positive value indicates
electron withdrawing properties, while a negative value indicates electron donation. The
magnitude tells us how much of an effect it has. Thus, for something like p-NO2, a large
positive value
(+0.78) is expected as it mesomerically withdraws electrons via the
benzene ring from the opposite benzoic carbon. This is less pronounced for m-NO2
(0.71) because the electrons cannot be mesomerically resonated directly into the NO2
group. Similarly, Cl groups show an even smaller value because they rely on inductive
effects only, which are not as powerful in withdrawal.
Conversely, positive values depend on the electron donating strength, so a group such
as MeO is more negative than Me when in the para position by the same argument.
Note however that MeO in the meta position is electron withdrawing, because the
donation cannot be resonated onto the benzoic C from this position, so inductive
electron withdrawal is the only electronic effect.
Thus, σx can be regarded as a measure of the overall polar effect exerted by a
substituent X on the reaction centre. Its sign indicates the direction. This is compared to
the effect of H (set to zero by the definition).
Physical Significance of the Reaction Constant:
This can be seen as the susceptibility of the reaction in question to the effects of the
substituent constant.
Thus, for a reaction with a sizeable negative reaction constant, there is typically seen to
be a build up of positive charge at or near the reaction centre. The reaction is thus
accelerated by electron donating substituents, which help delocalise the positive charge
forming in the transition state (and correspondingly retarded by electron withdrawing
groups).
Conversely, a positive reaction constant indicates a build up of negative charge at the
reaction centre, which is stabilising by electron withdrawal leading to a faster rate.
The magnitude of the reaction constant can be regarded as a measure of the change in
charge density at the reaction centre during the Transition State. Thus, it is expected to

decrease as the reaction centre is moved further away from the substituent (i.e. by
adding carbon groups at the benzylic position - unless these are conjugated with the
ring in which case the polar effects can still be transmitted effectively).
Acid Base Catalysis
Catalysis works in general to reduce the ∆G= for the reaction’s transition state, i.e. offer
an alternative, lower energy pathway by which to react. Both acids and bases can effect
this change on many reactions.
Acid catalysis usually works to make the substrate more electrophilic, while Base
catalysis results in the reactant being a better nucleophile to attack this substrate. This
can be further sub-divided into General and Specific cases of catalysis.
For general acid/base catalysis, proton transfer occurs in the rate determining step. It is
far more common than specific acid/base catalysis, and allows the catalyst to be any
acid or base as appropriate.
The rate laws take the form rate = Σ ki [S][Y] where Y is the base or acid as appropriate.
An example would be bromination of a ketone.
Specific acid/base catalysis requires that the catalyst is -OH or H3O+ only. An example
would be hydrolysis of an epoxide. In this case, proton transfer is very rapid, and forms a
pre-equilibrium step (not RDS). Here, rate = kKAS [S][H+].
There are also other possible catalytic routes for acid/base. One such example is
nucleophilic catalysis. The difference is that now the attack is on the reaction centre as
opposed to a H. There is no proton transfer in the rate determining step. It is highly
sensitive to the size of reactant and catalyst. A good example would be Iodo reactions,
such as CH3X + I- Æ CH3I - X +Y Æ CH3Y - I-. This works because Iodide is both a good
nucleophile (displacing X) and a good leaving group (vacating for Y), and thus both
steps are accelerated.
Another example of acid/base catalysis would be Lewis Acids and Bases. They work in a
similar way to Bronsted Acids/Bases but do not involve protons. Thus, they lower the
Activation Energy for the mechanism’s rate determining step.
For example,
Also, Phase Transfer Catalysts exist. They are often cations with several alkyl chains.
They work by forming ion pairs with the reagent anion, then move into the Organic
phase together. This means the anion has less hydration shells, which reduces the
Activation Energy (more reactive). The catalyst must move well between the phases in
order to function correctly. This is usually achieved by poor solvation in either phase.
Curtis-Hammett Principle
The Principle states that a product ratio from two interchanging conformers reacting is
dependent on both the conformational equilibrium constant and the rate ratios. Therefore

the final product ratio can favour the minority conformer if its rate of product formation is
high enough.
Take the reaction,
P1 Å C1 Ù C2 Æ P2 with rate constants k1 and k2 as appropriate.
C1 and C2 are conformers in equilibrium.
Derivation,
An example would be something like:
The Hammond Postulate
“If two states occur consecutively in a reaction process, and have nearly the same
energy,  the  interconversion  will  only  involve  a  small  reorganisation  of  molecular
structure.”
Thus, taking for example an SN2 reaction, if CH3I was attacked by I- there would be a
perfectly  symmetrical  Transition  State  with  properties  between  the  two  extremes.
However, for the more common asymmetric reaction, the Transition State is going to
either closely resemble reactants, products, or some intermediate to both.
Looking now at typical reaction schemes, it can be seen that for a highly exothermic
reaction, the Transition State will resemble the starting materials. This is shown by the
energy profile:

 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




- 7 -
Conversely, endothermic reactions give Transition States resembling products. Thus,
the Transition State is dependent on the relative energies of reactants, products and the
transition state itself.
The location of the Transition State leads in turn to selectivity. If the reagent is highly
reactive then the Transition State would lie close to the reactant’s energy. Thus,
pathways with different Activation Energies cannot be differentiated. With a lower energy
reagent, the Transition State will occur later in the reaction profile with a more product-
like property. Thus, the pathway with lower Activation Energy will occur more readily.
Principle of Microscopic Reversibility
This relates the forward and backward reactions of a system. It states that all reactions
are reversible (but we can’t always measure the reverse). Also, for the reverse reaction
occurring  at  higher  temperature,  we  can  guarantee  that  it  occurs  by  the  same
mechanism as the forward reaction, i.e. lowest energy pathways are the same in both
directions.
Looking at a reaction profile again to explain this:
Marcus Theory
This concerns proton transfer thus:
A-H + B Ù A--H--B+ Ù A- + H-B+.
i.e. in 3 stages, starting with diffusion of AH and B together, followed by proton transfer,
and finishing with A and BH diffusion away.
The free energy of this process implies both intrinsic (internal Energy) and extrinsic
(solvent reorganisation energy), and gives the equation:

Kinetic vs. Thermodynamic Control
Consider the following Energy Profile:
EA (P1) > EA (P2)
k1 > k2
Selective if [P1]/[P2] = k1/k2. This is the definition of kinetic control, where product ratios
are entirely governed by rate constants.
However, also considering that:
k2     k1
P2 Ù R Ù P1 (i.e. R now behaving as an intermediate).
k-2    k-1
It is now obvious that it is not entirely rate constant based, since reverse reactions have
not been considered. The thermodynamic aspect must be examined.
Hence, product ratios are proportional to the difference in Energies of P1 and P2.
[P1]/[P2] = K ln (∆G(P1) - ∆G(P2)).
Thus, over a long period of time, equilibrium is reached where [P1] > [P2], even though k1
< k2. It is said that P1 is the thermodynamic product, while P2 the kinetic product.
Evidence for Reactive Intermediates
Intermediates can sometimes be detected by either
trapping   them   chemically,   or   using   spectroscopic
techniques. This is because the intermediate occupies
a “dip” in the energy profile of the reaction, such that
moving  to  backwards  or  forwards  in  the  reaction
requires an energy change.
Identification chemically is often brought about by reacting them with other substrates,
indicating that they are stable enough to linger around long enough to react. There are
various categories of intermediate, some of which are:
Carbocations
-  carbons  bearing  a  positive  charge.  They  can  be  trapped  using
appropriate  anions.  They  are  also  often  shown  to  exist  in  a  mechanism  due  to
stereochemical outcomes (since they are planar sp2 hybrids, giving racemisation of
product on many occasions).
Carbenes - often react with solvent. Will also react with any suitable substrate added,
e.g. adding alkenes gives alkane with dichlorocarbon attachment.
Nitrenes - spectroscopic identification only, but extensively studied.
Arynes - identified by labelling carbons. For example,

pH vs. Rate Profiles
These can be used to determine mechanistically whether acid or base favours or
disfavours the reaction, and the mechanism can thus be confirmed.
For example, a reaction to form an imine shows a typical pH / rate profile such as this:
At low pH, Step 1 is rate determining, with rate = k [RNH2][R2CO]. Looking at the
mechanism, acid will favour dehydration to remove OH in the second step, but will slow
the first step by protonating the amine (making it a far weaker nucleophile). Thus, this fits
with the proposed mechanism.
As pH increases, Step 2 is rate determining, with rate = K k2 [RNH2][R2CO][H3O+]. This is
because now dehydration is slow since OH is a poor leaving group when not protonated
by acid. Since at high pH [H3O+] is slow, the rate law directly shows this is a slow step
under these conditions.
Alternatively, a pH / Rate profile might look like this:
This ester hydrolysis reaction shows the inverse of the above, and the reason is that the
reaction is in fact both acid and base catalysed. At low pH, the OR leaving group is
protonated to speed this step, while at high pH, H2O converts to -OH, which is a much
better Nucleophile for attack.
Unusual pH vs. rate profiles can result. For example, the reactions:
Where R = an ortho-
benzoic acid group.
Give rise to the rate profile as shown:
(1)
= protonation speeds the reaction.
(2)
= OH2 availability compromised by formation of H3O+.
(3)
= no H+/-OH effect Î nucleophilic catalysis using the R
group - pH4 matches the benzoic acid (R), and it can
reach a 6-membered transition state.
(4) Specific base catalysis.
