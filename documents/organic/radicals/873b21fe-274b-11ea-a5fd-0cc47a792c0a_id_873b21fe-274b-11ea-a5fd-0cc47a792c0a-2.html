FREE RADICALS NOTES
Definitions
Free radical - organic species with an unpaired electron, not including carbenes and
certain photochemically excited compounds.
Stabilised - include carbon-centred radicals, R•, for which the R-H bond strength is
less than that for the corresponding C-H in (1o/2o/3o) alkane. Usually transient.
Persistent - radicals with a lifetime significantly greater than methyl under the same
conditions. Not necessarily stabilised. Lifetimes range from seconds to years.
Examples:
Non-stabilised, persistent
Stabilised, persistent
Transient, non-stabilised
Me•
Transient, stabilised
Me3C•, allyl•
Valence Bond Picture of Heteroatom Stabilisation
Dative:
Therefore stabilised.
Capto:
Captodative:
Only radicals can do this (ionic Î one way is destabilised).

Photochemical cleavage of weak bonds
Useful as heat can destabilise compound.
Initiating compound must absorb light of appropriate wavelength to cleave the bond.
Note that the latter reaction is technically a “phototransformation”.
Electron Transfer
Electrolytic -
Redox (Fenton) -
Dissolving Metal -
SRN’ (Sandmeyer) -
Giese’s Mercury Method -
•   Room temperature.
•   No UV initiation.
•   Clean - Hg• by-product.
But, competing direction reduction is bad:
R-Hg-H + R• Æ RH + Hg•
Birch Reduction -
1 electron process.
Regiochemistry applies when substituted.
See other notes (e.g. Oxidation and Reduction Notes) for the mechanism.
Simple Reactions
Radical Combination -
Combining two radicals to terminate a chain reaction, R•+R• Æ R-R. Often slow due
to low concentrations of radicals generally. Only really viable for long-lived radicals or
via solvent cages (can be rapid in the latter case).
Radical Abstraction -
Attack often on a H atom or Halogen atom.

Can be thought of as displacement reaction.
Radical Addition -
Radicals can add to double or triple bonds, and it is often the case that anti-
Markovnikov product can be obtained by this route. For example:
Fragmentation -
This is the reverse of radical addition, and often occurs as β-elimination. An example
would be:
Rearrangements -
These are radical reactions that occur intramolecularly (often abstraction). It can lead
to cyclisation of long chain compounds.

Termination:
At low concentration, this is unlikely. Minimising termination thus involves:
•   Low concentration of radicals Î steady initiation (AIBN).
•   Fast propagation Î 2 x weak bonds to give 2 x strong bonds (e.g. Sn-H + R-I
Æ Sn-I + R-H).
Note that sometimes chain reactions do not occur, particularly with stable radicals or
those that are trapped in solvent cages, for example:

Determination of Reactivity and Regioselectivity
Bond Breaking
k = A e-E/RT
ln A ≈ same values for different R in CH3• + H-R Æ CH4 + R•.
Thus, similar entropy for bimolecular process. Hence, Ea is proportional to D(R-H).
ln k is also proportional to D(R-H) as a result [ linear correlation ], which implies bond
breaking is important in the rate determining step.
Bond Forming
ln A similar, so Ea is proportional to D(X-H). Dominates as in bond breaking.
ln k vs. D(X-H) is non-linear, i.e. bond forming may or may not be important Î early
or late Transition States (Hammond Postulate).

Hammond Postulate -
Thus, for H• abstraction by X•, when X = F reaction is very exothermic Î early
transition state (like starting materials), therefore little R-H breaking. Hence, T. State
is not greatly affected by R:
δ•
δ•
R-H--------F
F• highly reactive and unselective
When X = Br reaction is endothermic Î late transition state (like products). Thus
significant R-H breaking. T. State will be sensitive to the nature of R:
δ•
δ•
R--------H-Br
F• highly reactive and unselective
In general, halogens become less discriminating in H-abstraction in the order:
I > Br > Cl > F

But,
Selectivity
Consider:
For this to occur:
tBu• + HSnBu3 is very fast (3x105 M-1 s-1) so set [Bu3SnH] to be as low as possible.
Also set [H2C=CHCN] as high as possible.
Reason why there’s no polymerisation? See below.
Substituent Effects
β-effects
i.e. want electron withdrawing Z to stabilise T. State when nucleophilic radical.
Consider:

Electron withdrawing group Y favours Nucleophilic radical a little, but sterics usually
the dominant factor - often offset any electronically favourable effects operating.
Radical Substituents
Comparable to α-effects - generally slow addition.
Mechanism
Exothermic Î early transition state (Hammond Postulate).

Radicals in Synthesis
Functional Group Chemistry
General Points -
•   C-centred radicals are extremely reactive, yet they can be generated under
mild, neutral conditions and often undergo highly regio- and stereoselective
reactions.
•   Radical additions to C=C are usually exothermic and irreversible with early,
reactant-like Transition States. Kinetically controlled.
•   Since radicals are not cluttered with counterions or solvation spheres, radical
intermediates are ideally suited for synthesis at crowded bonds.
•   C-centred radicals are inert to OH and NH, therefore no protecting groups for
these. Exception: phenols (capto stabilised).
•   Unlike carbanions, carbon radicals are not subject to β-elimination of OR or
NR2.
•   Unlike carbocations, carbon radicals are not subject to capture by β-OR or -
NR2 groups, nor are they usually prone to migration of β-H or -CR3 groups.
They are, however, subject to β-elimination of SR, SOnR and SnR3 groups.

•   Radical centres do not usually retain stereochemistry. Can be a drawback,
but precursor synthesis is simplified (geometrically labile sp2-like radicals).
