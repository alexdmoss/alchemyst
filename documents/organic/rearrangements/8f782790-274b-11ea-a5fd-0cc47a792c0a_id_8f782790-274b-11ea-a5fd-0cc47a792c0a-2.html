REARRANGEMENTS NOTES
Mechanistic Aspects of Rearrangements
Nature of the Rearrangement
It can vary from being truly stepwise to migration occurring in concert with initial
ionisation. These two situations can be considered as intramolecular analogues of
SN1 and SN2 respectively. Hence, it has profound stereochemical implications at both
the migration origin and the terminus if the centres are chiral. With non-racemic
substrates, the generation of a free carbocation at either the migration terminus or
origin  will  result  in  loss  of  stereochemical  integrity  at  that  centre,  whereas  a
concerted migration with no intermediate will result in inversion of the absolute
stereochemistry at the terminus.
Migratory Aptitude
This is the ease with which any particular group will undergo nucleophilic 1,2-shifts. It
is related to electron donating capacity, but such values are not quantifiable as a
single group will show different aptitudes for different reactions/conditions.
Note that in some instances, for example the Beckmann Rearrangement, only one
group ever migrates regardless of the aptitude, simply because of stereoelectronic
requirements for the reaction. Likewise, in for example the pinacol rearrangement,
the most stable cation controls the reaction pathway, as opposed to the migrating
group.
A wide range of other factors, such as steric and conformational effects, play subtle
roles in determining whether a particular migration is favoured. Generally however,
aryl groups migrate more readily than alkyl groups, and within the aryl series, e-
donating substituents increase the propensity for migration. However, the position of
hydrogen within this framework is highly unpredictable.
Neighbouring Group Participation (Anchimeric Assistance)
This is where a substituent is capable of stabilising an adjacent carbocation by acting
as an intramolecular nucleophile. More details in the Stereoelectronics Notes.
Non-classical Carbonium Ions
While alkyl groups do not usually undergo σ-participation in acyclic or unstrained ring
systems, there is much evidence to suggest that this does occur in strained rings.
The species formed contain a two-electron, three-centre bond and are known as
“non-classical carbonium ions”. The most studied system in which σ-participation is
envisaged to occur is the 2-norbornyl system. It has been found that solvolysis of
optically pure norbornyl 2-exo-brosylate in acetic acid gave a racemic exo-acetate as
the sole product with no endo-material. Furthermore, it occurred 250 times faster.
These results were interpreted as implying that the reaction of the exo-substrate
occurred solely via a non-classical carbonium ion, whilst the endo substrate reacted
by initial formation of a classical carbenium ion which then rearranged to the non-
classical carbonium ion, but not before a small amount had reacted with solvent,
attack being sterically directed to the exo-face.

Carbocation Induced Alkyl and Hydride Shifts
Wagner-Meerwein Shifts
These 1,2-alkyl shifts occur if it leads to the new carbocation being more stabilised
than the original. This is usually the case if the carbon adjacent to the positively
charged centre is secondary or tertiary. Subsequent elimination will then occur.
Saytzeff’s Rule is obeyed to give the most substituted alkene.
1,2-alkyl shifts have a rigorous stereochemical requirement for the bond at the
migration origin to lie very close to the axis of the vacant p-orbital of the carbocationic
centre. Whilst acyclic systems can usually adopt the correct conformation for this
alignment, this option may not be open to cyclic systems.
Pinacol Rearrangement
Treatment of 1,2 diols with acid, which converts them to carbonyls. The reaction can
also occur on β-aminoalcohols, halohydrins, epoxides and allylic alcohols.
It proceeds via a 1,2 alkyl shift, and the overall reaction is:
Control can be exerted by conditions, e.g.
Tiffeneau-Demjanov Reaction
Similar to the pinacol rearrangement, but via a β-amino alcohol derivative. This
specific  reaction  leads  to  one  carbon  ring  expansion,  and  is  very  useful  for
homologating cyclic ketones to give products containing 4-8 carbon atoms in the ring.

This  type  of  reaction  can  also  occur  with  other  suitable  leaving  groups,  e.g.
bromohydrins.
Dienone-Phenol Rearrangement
Hydride Shifts
Less common than alkyl shifts, as the latter usually confers steric relief. 1,2-H shifts
are typically seen where steric requirements override this control.
Particular examples include transannular hydride migrations, where H’s move over
large distances in medium (C8-11) rings. This is possible as with these rings the H’s
can actually be quite close to other parts of the ring, as shown:
Such shifts were first noted when the acid catalysed opening of medium ring
epoxides was found to give only small amounts of the desired trans-1,2-diols.

Nucleophilic Rearrangements to Carbon (involving carbenes and carbanions)
Favorskii Rearrangement
Rearrangement of α-haloketones. Particularly useful for ring contraction. Labelling
was useful in showing the mechanism:
Ramberg-Backlund Rearrangement
Another rearrangement via a cyclic intermediate, and refers to the base promoted
conversion of α-halosulphones into alkenes.
Benzil-Benzilic Acid
Wolff Rearrangement
The ketene is usually attacked by an alcohol to give an ester.
Arndt-Eistert Reaction
Modification of Wolff Rearrangement.

Rearrangements to e-deficient N
Beckmann
The most important point to remember here is that the R group anti to the oxime N-O
bond is the one that migrates (i.e. R1 in the above), regardless of migratory aptitudes.
With certain substrates, particularly those in which one of the substituents on the
oxime is a tertiary alkyl group or possess a β-heteroatom substituent, a nitrile may be
formed  by  a  fragmentation  process  instead  of  a  rearrangement.  This  is  the
Secondary Beckmann Reaction, and is a consequence of the enhanced stability of
the carbocation produced under these circumstances.
Neber Rearrangement
Similar  reagents  to  the  Beckmann  Rearrangement,  except  for  the  important
distinction that the Neber occurs in base, while the Beckmann is in acid. The key
synthetic difference ins that there is no dependence on stereochemistry of the oxime
sulphonate, i.e. which substituent possesses the most acid α-position migrates, not
necessarily the anti one.
Curtius Rearrangement
Carboxylic acid to primary amine with one less carbon atom. Prepare isocyanate:
Hydrolysis:

Lossen Rearrangement
Mechanistically very similar to Curtius Rearrangement. Difficult to obtain starting
material though, although only requires water to carry out. Base catalysed.
Schmidt Rearrangement
Similar steps to Curtius above, although formation of acyl azide differs, being acid
catalysed:
Hofmann Rearrangement
Similar net result to the above 3 rearrangements, but the formation of the isocyanate
again differs.
Stieglitz Rearrangement
Nucleophilic migration from carbon to nitrogen.
Rearrangements to e-deficient O
Baeyer-Villiger Rearrangement
This is a rearrangement to electron deficient oxygen. Converts ketones to esters, and
cyclic ketones to lactones.
Dakin Reaction

 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




- 7 -
Aromatic aldehydes and ketones possessing a hydroxyl or amino group in either the
ortho or para position can be converted to phenols on treatment with alkaline
hydrogen peroxide. Mechanistically similar to Baeyer-Villiger.
Electrophilic Rearrangements
Stevens
Sommelet-Hauser Rearrangement
Meisenheimer Rearrangement
Similar  to  the  two  preceding  reactions.  Tertiary  N-Oxide  undergoes  thermal
rearrangement, where the migrating group is usually benzylic or allylic. If any of the
groups possess a β-hydrogen, Cope elimination predominates, limiting the synthetic
utility of this rearrangement.
Wittig Rearrangement

- 8 -
Analogous to the Stevens Rearrangement above, but Oxygen instead of Nitrogen. It
also requires stronger bases than Stevens.
Smiles Rearrangement
Carbon to Carbon Electrophilic Migration
Note that these are far rarer than the carbocation induced nucleophilic migrations
encountered earlier. Requires exceptional circumstances of steric and electronic
effects in combination.
It is known to occur in metallation of triaryl-2-haloalkanes, e.g.
Acid Catalysed Aromatic Rearrangements
Jacobsen Rearrangement

Note that the product above can be desulphonated (by reversing the first step), such
that the Me groups have been rearranged. The reaction is driven to the point where
the most stable arenium ion is formed.
Fries Rearrangement
Note the temperature control of the products. The mechanism is not well understood
with regards to whether it is inter or intramolecular migration.
Note that there are similar reactions which involve the migration of the R group from
an  aryl  ether,  and  similarly  the  R  group  from  an  alkylarylamine.  Both  lack
stereochemical control though.
Benzidine Rearrangement
The mechanism for this is:
