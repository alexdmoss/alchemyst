STEREOSELECTIVE SYNTHESIS NOTES
Definitions
Chemoselectivity -
We can envisage two modes:
a)   Substrate selectivity. Preferential reaction of one of several functional groups in the
molecule with the reagent. In general the less reactive the reagent the more selective the
reaction of chemically similar functional groups that can be achieved.
b)   Product selectivity. In the case where reaction of a functional group can lead to several
chemically distinct products, this occurs when a non-statistical ratio of products is
observed.
Regioselectivity -
Preferential formation of one structural isomer over any others.
Stereoselectivity -
Preferential formation of one stereoisomer over any others. Obviously a diastereoselective
reaction leads to the preferential formation of one diastereoisomer and an enantioselective
reaction leads to the preferential formation of one enantiomer.
The term stereospecific is used in two instances:
(i)
For a reaction where a single stereoisomer is converted completely to a single
product stereoisomer. Textbook definitions define a process as being stereospecific
only when starting materials differing only in their configuration are converted to
stereoisomerically different products.
(ii)
Can also be applied to a process that is completely stereoselective.
Topicity
Groups or faces of a molecule may display topicity. Strict definitions refer to whether such groups
/ faces are interchangeable by particular types of symmetry operations, but it is more useful to
consider the concept in relation to the outcome of possible “future” reactions.
Prochirality
When replacement of one of a pair of groups or reaction on one of two molecular faces leads to
the formation of a chiral material then these groups / faces are termed prochiral. Prochirality
descriptions to both groups and faces can be assigned by the use of the standard Cahn-Ingold-
Prelog rules. These are very useful, particularly when considering addition reactions.
Faces:

Selectivity of Enolate Formation
(More on this can be found further on)
Kinetic Control - enolate composition is governed by the relative rates of proton abstraction.
Thermodynamic Control - enolate composition is governed by the relative stabilities of the
enolates.
Kinetic Enolates
Usually the less substituted enolate.
Favoured by rapid irreversible deprotonation at low temperatures. Use of bulky bases favours
kinetic deprotonation at the least hindered site, e.g. LDA, ButLi. Li is usually used as the
counterion since the higher covalent character prevents equilibration.
Thermodynamic Enolates
Usually the more substituted enolate.
Former at higher temperature under conditions of reversible deprotonation, e.g. in the presence
of a weak acid. Judged as the more stable enolate by consideration as an olefin: increased
substitution increases the stability.
Diastereoselectivity in Additions to Acyclic RCHO and R2CO
1,2 Asymmetric Induction
The influence of a chiral centre α to the carbonyl group.
Cram’s Rule and Modifications
A purely empirical rule. The three substituents on the α carbon are ranked L (large), M (medium),
and S (small) in terms of steric bulk. The carbonyl compound is presumed to react in a
These Notes are copyright Alex Moss 2003. They may be reproduced without need for permission.

- 4 -
conformation where the largest (L) of the substituents on the α carbon is eclipsed with the
carbonyl substituent R (hydrogen in the case of aldehydes). The direction of nucleophilic attack is
then predicted to be the same side of the carbonyl as the small substituent, S, rather than attack
form the side of the medium substituent M.
Although this rule has great utility there are significant exceptions to it. The following points are
notable:
(a) No distinction is made between ground state and reactive conformations. The postulate
that conformation A makes a significant contribution to the ground state conformation is
unlikely.
(b) In view of the low rotational barriers around C-C bonds then more than one reactive
conformation may be involved (by the Curtin-Hammett Principle). The likelihood that
amongst thermally available conformations that conformation A makes a significant
contribution is small since conformation A leads to fully eclipsed conformations B and C.
(c) The substituents on the α carbon are classified merely with respect to their steric bulk;
any dipolar effects are ignored.
Modifications:
(i)
Cornforth’s dipolar model suggests that any electronegative substituent on the α
carbon  will  preferentially  occupy  the  L  position
-  due  to  favourable  dipolar
interactions. Nucleophilic addition then occurs from the less hindered face.
(ii)
Chelation Model is used in the case of an α substituent that is capable of binding to
the metal (itself complexed with the carbonyl group), e.g. α alkoxy, hydroxy and
amino carbonyls. Chelate formation occurs prior to addition of the organometallic to
the carbonyl group. This subsequently occurs to the less hindered face of the chelate
- this may result in induction that is opposite to that predicted by the simple Cram’s
Rule.
Chelation (a) enhances the electrophilic nature of the carbonyl and (b) prevents
rotation about the C-C bond and compels the nucleophile to add from the least
hindered face.

 www.alchemyst.f2o.org 




- 5 -
In general this is more powerful than the simple Cram Model, and chelation controlled
reactions proceed with very high levels of asymmetric induction, e.g.
(iii)
Felkin-Anh   Model.   The   most   satisfactory   explanation   based   on   theoretical
calculations:
Molecular modelling showed that in fact the two lowest energy conformations are C
and D. An important point was the realisation that nucleophilic attack does not occur
perpendicularly to the carbonyl group as was previously thought. Thus, preferred
reaction occurs via a transition state like D where the nucleophile attacks next to the
small (S) group rather than via C where nucleophilic attack is disfavoured by the
increased bulk of the medium (M) group.
Allylic 1,3 Strain and use for 1,2 and 1,3 Asymmetric Induction
Torsional strain between allyl substituents produces a conformational preference:
NB: only a couple of lowest energy conformers drawn.
Z substitution of an alkene increases this conformational preference to a
size   where   it   allows   high   levels   of   asymmetric   induction.   If   the
neighbouring allylic centre is chiral this can allow stereocontrol of addition
reactions to the alkene providing groups R1 and R2 differentiate the faces
of the double bond.

Substituted Borohydrides -
o   Electronic effects of R substitution changes efficiency of hydride donation.
o   Inductive withdrawal of CN reduces e-density on B, resulting in a less potential (more
stable) hydride donor.
o   Electron density on B increased - more potent source of hydride.
o   The counter-ion is also important. LiBH4 is more reactive than NaBH4 - explanation:
Li is a Lewis Acid which activates the carbonyl to attack.

Diastereoselective Alkene Formation
The Salt-Free Wittig Reaction
With non-stabilised ylids under salt-free conditions, Z-1,2-disubstituted olefins are favoured with

In the salt-free Wittig reaction, the ylid is generated from the phosphonium salt with a base such
as sodium amide. The NaX salt that is formed is filtered off to leave the naked extremely highly
reactive phosphorane.

Carbocupration of Alkynes - Synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes.
One of the most valued properties of RCu.MgX2 reagents is their ability to add across the triple
bond of terminal acetylenes. Such processes are termed carbocupration reactions and they lead
to the formation of synthetically useful vinylcopper intermediates.
Hydro- and Carboalumination of Terminal Alkynes - Synthesis of di- and trisubstituted
alkenes
Alkynes undergo cis-addition in hydrocarbon solvents to give E-vinyl alanes which can be
converted to the corresponding reactive ate complexes. These complexes react readily with many
different electrophiles with complete preservation of the E-vinyl alane geometry.
In the presence of zirconocene dichloride, trimethylaluminium will add cis across terminal alkynes
to give methyl E-trisubstituted vinylalanes. These can be converted to the more reactive ate
complexes through reaction with an alkyllithium which can then be trapped with a variety of
electrophiles with retention of vinyl geometry.

Thallium hydroxide can dramatically increase the rate of this coupling.
The Stille Reaction
Alkylation of Enolates
Enolate Reactivity
The reactivity of an enolate is very sensitive to its state of aggregation, which in turn is influenced
by the reaction medium.
Polar aprotic solvents are good cation solvators and poor anion solvators, and therefore provide a
medium in which enolate-metal ion pairs are dissociated to give a less encumbered more reactive
enolate.
Polar protic solvents are less favourable as solvents in enolate alkylation because they can
coordinate to both the metal cation and the enolate ion.
THF and DME are slightly polar solvents, which are moderately good cation solvators but these
solvents, because of their low dielectric constants, are less effective in separating ion pairs, and
higher aggregates than are the polar aprotic solvents.
The reactivity of enolates is also affected by the metal counterion. The order of reactivity is
generally: Mg2+ < Li+ < Na+ < K+.

- 14 -
Effect of the electrophile - HSAB Principle
Of the two nucleophilic sites in an enolate ion, oxygen is harder than carbon. The hard-hard
combination is favoured by an early transition state where the charge distribution is the most
important factor. Therefore, conditions that favour a dissociated more reactive enolate favour O-
alkylation.
The soft-soft combination is favoured by a later transition state where partial bond formation is
important. The product of C-alkylation is more stable than the product of O-alkylation.
Effect of the Solvent
Polar aprotic solvents (HMPA, DMF) promote O-alkylation (the enolate is most free) and ethereal
solvents promote C-alkylation (aggregation and ion clustering). In polar protic solvents such as t-
Butanol, C-alkylation is more favourable.
Effect of the Counterion
Larger alkali metals give more separated ion pairs, which are harder and therefore favour O-
alkylation.
Stereoelectronic Effects
For intramolecular alkylation of enolates, Baldwin’s Rules are followed.
Stereochemistry of Enolate Formation
The E:Z ratio depends on the reaction conditions and the nature of the substituents.
E enolates are often formed preferentially under kinetic conditions (except if R is large). Z
enolates are generally thermodynamically more stable.

Extra-Annular Control Elements
Alkylation of an imidazole derived enolate under extra-annular stereocontrol:
π-Facial selectivity based on the minimisation of allylic strain A(1,3):
The Aldol Reaction
The name Aldol is given to a whole class of reactions between enol (or enolates) and carbonyl
compounds even though in most cases the product is not a hydroxyl-aldehyde.
For cross-aldol reactions, several “levels” of control need to be addressed. Two methods are
known that allow to control the product outcome of the reaction - in other words to ensure that
one carbonyl group gives only one enol or enolate as the nucleophilic partner in the Aldol
reaction, while only one carbonyl compound acts as the electrophilic partner.
In the equilibrium method, the reagents must be treated with weak (usually aqueous or
alcoholic) acid or base and allowed to equilibrate with all possible enols or enolates. Either only
one product is possible (this might be due to symmetry or blocking of the α-positions) or some
thermodynamic factors (such as the formation of the more stable conjugated enone) ensure that
the reaction proceeds along one preferential reaction pathway.
In the directed Aldol, one component is premodified and converted into a specific enol
equivalent (such as lithium enolate, silyl enol ether, enamine, aza-enolate, zinc enolate) and only
then combined with the electrophilic partner. If the ketone is unsymmetrical and presents two
possible reactive sites (regioisomeric enol equivalents), the regioselectivity can be controlled in
the step involving the conversion of the ketone into an enol equivalent.

In addition to the product outcome and the control of regioselectivity (if any), there are two major
stereochemical issues that must be addressed. The first is the relative configuration of the two
newly created stereogenic centers. The second issue concerns diastereofacial selectivity and
arises from the addition of achiral enolates to chiral aldehydes or the vice versa.
Relative Configuration (Simple diastereoselectivity) - Addition of achiral enolates to achiral
aldehydes
Zimmerman-Traxler Transition State Structures for the Aldol Reaction
R3 adopts a preferential equatorial position. The position of R1 is predetermined by the enolate
geometry.
Examples of simple diastereoselectivity:
When the Aldol reaction is carried out under reversible conditions, it is generally found that the
anti  isomer  predominates.  If  it  is  assumed  that  chelated  products  are  more  likely  to  be
thermodynamically more stable than non-chelated products, this stereochemical outcome might

be rationalised by consider the Newman projections for the two possible aldolates. Aldol products
can undergo syn/anti isomerisation more commonly by reverse aldolisation.
In most cases however, reactions are kinetically controlled.
Diastereofacial Selectivity in Aldol Reactions
Chiral aldehyde with achiral enolate
The two faces of the chiral aldehyde are diastereotopic. Therefore the reaction of a chiral
aldehyde with an achiral enolate gives rise to a mixture of diastereoisomers. The major product
can be predicted in line with Cram’s model.
•   The 2,3 relative stereochemistry is determined by the enolate geometry.
•    The 3,4 relative stereochemistry is determined by the diastereofacial selectivity of the
addition of the aldehyde.

- 19 -
Achiral Aldehyde with chiral Enolate
The two faces of the enolate are diastereotopic. Preferential addition of the aldehyde will occur on
the less hindered face of the enolate leading again to some degree of diastereofacial selectivity.
Usually excellent levels of selectivity have been obtained for many chiral enolates derived from

Chiral Aldehyde with Chiral Enolate - Double Stereodifferentiation
When more than one participant is chiral, the stereochemical outcome will depend to a degree on
the relationship between their respective absolute configurations and the proximity of stereogenic
elements in the transition state structures.
In the case of the Aldol reaction, both the aldehyde and the enolate have their own inherent
diastereofacial selectivity. If the pair is matched, then these selectivities will act in unison
(synergic effect). Often very high levels of diastereofacial selectivity can be observed. This
combined interaction between the chiral centres in both the aldehyde and the enolate is termed
double stereodifferentiation.
If the diastereofacial selectivities of the two partners are in the same sense (matched pair), then
the two effects reinforce each other and very high selectivity can be observed.
Complementary Selectivity:
If the diastereofacial selectivities of the two partners are in opposite senses (mismatched pair)
then the two effects oppose each other and reduced selectivity will be observed.
Opposed Selectivity:

Asymmetric Synthesis
What do we mean by asymmetric synthesis - a reaction that creates one configuration of new
stereogenic  elements  by  the  action  of  a  chiral  reagent  or  auxiliary  acting  on  heterotopic
(enantiotopic or diastereotopic) faces, atoms or groups of a substrate.
Why we always need a chiral component to achieve asymmetric synthesis? Let’s consider the
three possible scenarios for a model reaction, the addition of a nucleophile to a carbonyl
compound:
Achiral carbonyl compound in the presence of an achiral nucleophile:
The two faces (Re and Si) of the achiral compound are enantiotopic. The nucleophile can attack
either face leading to two possible transition states. If the nucleophile is itself achiral then these
two transition states are enantiomeric and therefore equal in energy. The two enantiomeric
transition states lead to the formation of the two enantiomeric products in equal amount, in which
case a racemic mixture is formed. In other words, if there is no chiral information in the reaction,
then a racemic mixture will always result.
Chiral carbonyl compound in the presence of an achiral nucleophile:
This is related to the Cram Rule / Felkin-Ahn model. If the carbonyl compound is including within
its structure a stereogenic centre, the two faces of the carbonyl group are now diastereotopic and
no longer enantiotopic.

If the group A* denotes a group containing a stereogenic centre, an achiral nucleophile can attack
either face of the carbonyl compound, but the two transition states are no longer enantiomeric but
diastereomeric. Therefore these two transition states are different in energy and consequently,
one of the two diastereomers will be formed preferentially.
Achiral carbonyl compound with a chiral nucleophile:
The two faces of the carbonyl compound are enantiotopic and the nucleophile can attack either
one. However since the nucleophile is chiral, the two transition states for these two reactions
must be diastereomeric. Therefore the reaction leads to the preferential formation of one
diastereomer as the two diastereomeric transition states are not equal in energy.
Conclusion: Asymmetric synthesis takes place via diastereomeric transition states and takes
advantage of the difference in energy between these two transition states in order to obtain
preferentially one product.
Chemical separation of enantiomers via diastereomers
The largest number of recorded resolution has been
affected by conversion of a racemate to a mixture of
diastereomers. In this type of reaction, the substrate to
be resolved is treated with one enantiomer of a chiral
substance (the resolving agent). The vast majority of
resolutions mediated by diastereomers (diastereomeric
salt mixture in particular) have been based on solubility
differences of solids. However, chromatography has
freed resolutions from the constraint of dependency on
crystallisation as the technique on which diastereomer separation has traditionally depended.
Resolving agents are currently available for acids and lactones, bases, amino acids, alcohols,
diols, thiols, dithiols, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, etc.

Kinetic Resolution and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution -
The enzymatic resolution of racemic amino acid derivatives is a fairly common kinetic resolution
method wherein one enantiomer of the racemate is recovered as the unhydrolysed derivative
while the other may be recovered from the hydrolysate as a pure amino acid or as a new amino
acid derivative. In this case, the maximum yield of the desired enantiomer cannot exceed 50%.
A dynamic kinetic resolution allows in theory the formation of the desired enantiomer with a
chemical yield of
100% as the kinetic resolution process is coupled with the spontaneous
racemisation of the starting material (but not the product!) under the reaction’s conditions:
The Use of  Chiral Reagent
One typical example is the use of chiral hydride reagents that might afford good level of
enantioselection in the reduction of ketones. Much of this has centered on lithium aluminium
hydride modified by the attachment of chiral ligands such as diols, diamines, aminocarbinol, etc.
One of these reagents so-called BINAL-H (BINAL is the complex formed from equimolar amounts
of lithium aluminium hydride, 2,2’-dihydroxy-1,-1’-binaphtyland ethanol) which is available as
either enantiomer provided excellent result with enantiomeric excesses up to 95% - 100% from
the reduction of a reasonable range of ketones. In general poor enantiomeric excesses are
obtained when both groups attached to the carbonyl group are alkyl groups.
The Use of a Chiral Auxiliary
This principle will be illustrated with the asymmetric alkylation of a homochiral oxazoline as
developed by Meyers et al. In this strategy, the prochiral substrate is attached to a chiral non-
racemic group known as the chiral auxiliary, and this is done prior to the reaction, here an
alkylation. The two possible products become now diastereomeric and one should be formed in
excess providing that the difference in energy between the two diastereomeric transition states is
sufficiently large. The major diastereomer can be isolated and then the chiral auxiliary is cleaved
to afford the desired enantio-enriched / pure product. After cleavage, the chiral auxiliary can be
recycled.
The Use of a Chiral Catalyst
This type of asymmetric synthesis is extremely attractive as a small amount of the homochiral
catalyst leads to stoichiometric amounts of the desired enantiomer. In the laboratory, both
enzymes and synthetic catalysts are used to achieve asymmetric synthesis. Up to now, many
examples  were  based  on  the  use  of  an  organometallic  catalyst  such  as  the  Sharpless
Epoxidation:

More recently it has been demonstrated that small organocatalysts are suitable candidates for
various asymmetric catalytic transformations such as Aldol reactions or Diels-Alder reactions.
Product Analysis
Enantiomeric excess (or e.e) = % major enantiomer formed - % minor enantiomer formed. If a
reaction gives 75% of the R enantiomer and 25% of the S enantiomer, then the e.e. 75% - 25% =
50%. Enantiomeric excesses are almost always quoted after reactions as a guideline to how
enantioselective a particular process is. The key problem is therefore “how do you work out just
how much of each enantiomer you have?”
Polarimetry
Chiral compounds rotate the plane of polarised light. The oldest and simplest method of analysis
therefore relies on measuring the optical activity of the sample (how much the plane of light is
rotated) and comparison of this value with the value obtained for the pure single enantiomer. The
sign of the rotation reflects the absolute configuration (R or S) of the sample whereas the value
(size) of the rotation represents the optical purity of the sample.
Specific Rotation - [α]TD = 100α/I.c
α = measured optical rotation.
I = path length of cell.
c = concentration of the sample.
T = temperature of the sample.
d = defines the wavelength as the sodium D line (590nm), other wavelength light may be used.
% optical purity = measured specific rotation x 100/specific rotation of the pure enantiomer
This is usually equal to the e.e.
Derivatisation
Reaction of a mixture of enantiomers with a chiral entity produces a mixture of diastereomers.
Analysis or separation of this diastereomeric mixture is then straightforward. However there are
several important drawbacks. It is crucial that the derivatisation reaction goes to completion so
that the diastereomeric ratio accurately reflects the original enantiomeric ratio. Any kinetic
resolution must be avoided and of course the reaction conditions for derivatisation must not
cause racemisation. A typical reagent to achieve the derivatisation of secondary alcohols is the
Mosher acid. NMR 1H, 13C or 19F can be used to observe the diastereomeric mixture.

Chiral Shift Reagents
In situ NMR analysis of enantiomeric ratios can be achieved by the use of chiral shift reagents
(CSA’s). These are chiral complexes of lanthanide metals, usually europium, ytterbium or
praseodymium with chiral β-dicarbonyl compounds. Two of the most common ligands are TFC or
HFC:
The lanthanide metals are hard Lewis Acids and coordinate to any hard Lewis base sites on the
molecule of interest (e.g. hydroxyl groups, ketones, aldehydes, ethers, esters, etc.)
Separation through chiral media (chiral GC or HPLC)
Principle of column chromatography: one stationary phase and one mobile phase. In gas
chromatography, the stationary phase is a liquid and the mobile phase is a gas. In high pressure
liquid chromatography, the stationary phase is a solid and the mobile phase is a liquid. If the
stationary phase is chiral, the interaction between the stationary phase and the two enantiomers
that are being eluted become diastereomeric and therefore could be separated.

molecules  as  organic  catalyst  despite  the  widespread  availability  of  organic  chemicals  in
enantiopure form and the accordant potential for academic, industrial and economic benefit.
Asymmetric Allylations: The Use of Chiral Allyl Boranes
For allylboranes bearing a substituents at the terminal position, two stereogenic centres could be
created upon addition of these allylboranes onto aldehydes.
Z-allylboranes give syn products.
E-allylboranes give anti products.
If chiral ligands are attached to boron, high level of enantioselectivity can be achieved since the
two transition states are no longer enantiomeric but diastereomeric.

Examples:
Stereoselective Glycoside Formation
Fischer Glycosidation
The terms glycosidation and glycosylation are frequently used interchangeable.
A glycoside is a carbohydrate substituted at the anomeric centre, usually with alcohols. In the
presence of an acid catalyst, an alcohol can react with a sugar lactol hemiacetal to form an acetal
that is called a glycoside. This is an equilibrium reaction and therefore treatment of a glycoside
with aqueous acid can reverse this reaction and give the parent carbohydrate. The reaction is
under thermodynamic control and therefore the thermodynamic product is formed preferentially.

Nucleophilic Substitution at the Anomeric Centre
Acetylation is often the first step of synthetic sequences involving sugars. Conversion of the
hydroxyl group at the anomeric position into an acetate is useful as the acetate can readily act as
a leaving group under the appropriate conditions and therefore many other anomeric substituents
may be introduced by nucleophilic substitution reactions.
Anomeric acetates are themselves precursors for the introduction of other substituents at the
anomeric position. Two important synthetic intermediates that could be prepared from anomeric
acetates are glycosyl bromides or thioglycosides.
Mechanism of nucleophilic substitution at the anomeric centre - SN1 or SN2 -
Neighbouring Group Participation
There are several strategies to control the stereochemical outcome of nucleophilic substitution
reactions at the anomeric centre. One of the most successful strategies is by neighbouring group
participation of an ester protecting group such as acetate or benzoate on the 2-hydroxyl group.
The net result is that the newly formed anomeric linkage is necessarily trans to the 2-hydroxyl
group.

Solvent Effect
The reaction solvent can have a marked effect on the stereochemical outcome of the reaction. A
good example is the stereoselective formation of β-linked disaccharides from glycosyl donors that
do not possess a participating group at the 2-position. An example is presented below and
involves the direct participation of the solvent in the reaction mechanism:
Molecular Tethering - Intramolecular aglycon delivery
How can we form stereoselectively 1,2-cis glycosidic linkages? Overcome this synthetic problem
by  temporarily  tying  together  the  donor  and  acceptor  before  the  glycosylation  reaction  is
performed - molecular tethering. Subsequent activation of the donor glycoside is then followed by
intramolecular delivery of the acceptor:
Chemical Disaccharide Formation
The glycosyl acceptor is the nucleophile. The glycosyl donor is the electrophile.
