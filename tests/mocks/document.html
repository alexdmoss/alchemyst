<h2>Hydrogenic Atoms</h2>

<h3>Orbital Angular Momentum & Electron Spin</h3>

<h4>Quantum Numbers</h4>

<p>Principal Quantum Number - Quantized Energy</p>

<p>Orbital Angular Momentum, <em>l</em> - Quantized Orbital Angular Momentum</p>

<p>Magnetic Quantum Number, m<sub>l</sub> - Quantized Orientation of angular momentum.</p>

<p>The allowed energies are determined by n, and for a hydrogenic atom of atomic number Z:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/alchemyst-assets/docs/inorganic/atomic_structure/1.png" /></p>

<p>The zero energy is when electron and nucleus are widely separated. 1/n<sup>2</sup> relationship for E indicates that the energy levels converge at high (less negative) energies. Zero energy = ionisation.</p>

<h4>Electron Spin -</h4>

<p>2 more Quantum Numbers are needed to define the state of an electron (spin).</p>

<p>s = spin angular momentum and always has a value of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>ms = spin magnetic quantum number, and is either +<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> or -<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>These Quantum Numbers specify the orientation of the spin with respect to a chosen axis.</p>

<p>Spin-up and Spin-down (α and β).</p>


<h3>Shapes and Energies of Atomic Orbitals</h3>

<h4>Radial Shapes of Hydrogenic Orbitals</h4>

<p>A Hydrogenic orbital can be written as the product of a function R of the radius and a function Y of the angular coordinates. R determines variation with distance. Y expresses the shape of the orbital.</p>

<p>Where the radial wavefunction passes through zero is a radial node. Where the angular wavefunction passes thru zero is an angular node or nodal plane.</p>

<p>1s (n=1, l=0, m<sub>l</sub>=0) decays exponentially with distance from the nucleus and never passes thru zero.</p>

<p>An orbital with Quantum Numbers n and l in general has n-<em>l</em>-1 radial nodes. Hence 2s (n=2, l=0 m<sub>l</sub>=0) passes thru zero once (one radial node).</p>

<h2>Multi-electron Atoms</h2>

<h3>Penetration & Screening</h3>

<h4>Shielding</h4>

<p>An electron is assumed to experience an effective nuclear charge (Z<sub>eff</sub>) dependent on radius (location), n and <em>l</em> (differing radial distribution functions). The reduction of the true nuclear charge to the effective nuclear charge is called shielding. Z<sub>eff</sub> = Z - σ.</p>

<p>The closer to the nucleus that an electron can penetrate in an atom, the closer the value of Z<sub>eff</sub> to Z, because the electron is repelled less by other electrons. For example, a 2s electron can penetrate, while a 2p electron is not as effective at this because it has a nodal plane through the nucleus. Therefore, it is more shielded from the nucleus by the electrons of the core. We can conclude that a 2s electron has lower energy (more bound) than a 2p, so for Lithium the ground state configuration must be 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>1</sup>. It usually follows that: ns > np > nd > nf</p>

<h3>Radial Distribution Functions</h3>

<p align="center">(for 1s orbital)</p>

<p>In general, the distance at which the electron is most likely to be found decreases with nuclear charge. The distance also increases as n increases since the higher the energy, the more likely the electron is to be further away. Maximum (most likely) position occurs at a<sub>0</sub>/Z.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/alchemyst-assets/docs/inorganic/atomic_structure/4.png" /></p>

<p>Although 2p is on average closer, the 2s has a higher probability of being close to the nucleus because of the inner maximum.</p>

<h2>Periodicity</h2>
<h3>Ionic Radii</h3>

<p>Metallic Radius = half the distance between nuclei of neighbouring atoms.</p>

<p>Covalent Radius = half the inter-nuclear separation of neighbouring atoms of the same element.</p>

<p>General Periodic Trends - descending a group atomic radii increase, and with s & p blocks they decrease from left to right across period.</p>

<p>Period 6 is different, due to lanthanide contraction. The 4f orbitals are being occupied by the lanthanides, and these have poor shielding properties. The repulsions being added on crossing the f-block fail to compensate for the increasing nuclear charge, so all the electrons are drawn inwards (Z<sub>eff</sub> increases).</p>

<p>Similar reasoning behind the small increase in radius from Al to Ga - d-block with poor shielding.</p>

<p>Increase in radius of an anion is due to increased electron-electron repulsions. Smaller radius of cations is due to less repulsion and also that there is a less in valence electrons (leaving a more compact core).</p>

<h3>Ionization Energy</h3>

<p>Follows pattern of Z<sub>eff</sub>. Correlate with atomic radii - small radius = high E<sub>I</sub>.</p>

<h3>Electron Affinity</h3>

<p>Electron-gain enthalpy - ∆<sub>eg</sub>H is the standard enthalpy change per mole of atoms when a gas-phase atom gains an electron. Can be exothermic or endothermic.</p>

<p align="center">A(g) + e<sup>-</sup>(g) --> A<sup>-</sup>(g)</p>

<p align="center">E<sub>a</sub> = E(A,g) - E(A<sup>-</sup>,g)</p>

<p>A positive electron affinity indicates that the ion has a lower (more -ve), and so more favourable energy than the neutral atom. Its value is determined by the energy of the lowest unfilled orbital of the ground-state atom. An element has a high electron affinity if the additional electron can enter a shell where it experiences a strong effective nuclear charge. This is the case for elements in the top right of the periodic table.</p>
