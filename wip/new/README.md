# PDF Conversion

Fiddling around with some Python options here - cleared out `pyproject.toml` as getting loads of vulnerability notifications and this code never runs anywhere remotely.

If looking to bring this back, then tried the following:

```py
pdftotree = "*"
aspose-words-cloud = "*"
pycryptodome = "*"
pdfminer = "*"
```

... but tbh I would probably be more tempted by something GenAI-ish now!
